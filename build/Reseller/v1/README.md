## API Reference

### `customers`

#### `customers.get()`

Gets a customer account. Use this operation to see a customer account already in your reseller management, or to see the minimal account information for an existing customer that you do not manage. For more information about the API response for existing customers, see [retrieving a customer account](https://developers.google.com/workspace/admin/reseller/v1/how-tos/manage_customers#get_customer).

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.customerId` | `string` | Yes | This can be either the customer's primary domain name or the customer's unique identifier. If the domain name for a customer changes, the old domain name cannot be used to access the customer, but the customer's unique identifier (as returned by the API) can always be used. We recommend storing the unique identifier in your systems where applicable. |

#### `customers.insert()`

Orders a new customer's account. Before ordering a new customer account, establish whether the customer account already exists using the [`customers.get`](https://developers.google.com/workspace/admin/reseller/v1/reference/customers/get) If the customer account exists as a direct Google account or as a resold customer account from another reseller, use the `customerAuthToken\` as described in [order a resold account for an existing customer](https://developers.google.com/workspace/admin/reseller/v1/how-tos/manage_customers#create_existing_customer). For more information about ordering a new customer account, see [order a new customer account](https://developers.google.com/workspace/admin/reseller/v1/how-tos/manage_customers#create_customer). After creating a new customer account, you must provision a user as an administrator. The customer's administrator is required to sign in to the Admin console and sign the G Suite via Reseller agreement to activate the account. Resellers are prohibited from signing the G Suite via Reseller agreement on the customer's behalf. For more information, see [order a new customer account](https://developers.google.com/workspace/admin/reseller/v1/how-tos/manage_customers#tos).
