The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be `=`, `!=`, `>`, or `<`. For example, if you are filtering a list of private clouds, you can exclude the ones named `example-pc` by specifying `name != "example-pc"`. You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `networkConfig.managementCidr = "192.168.0.0/24"` to include private clouds only if they have a matching address in their network configuration. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (name = "example-pc") (createTime > "2021-04-12T08:15:10.40Z") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.

     * @param {string} apiParams.orderBy - Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, returned results are ordered by `name` in ascending order. You can also sort results in descending order based on the `name` value using `orderBy="name desc"`. Currently, only ordering by `name` is supported.
     * @param {integer} apiParams.pageSize - The maximum number of private clouds to return in one page. The service may return fewer than this value. The maximum value is coerced to 1000. The default value of this field is 500.
     * @param {string} apiParams.pageToken - A page token, received from a previous `ListPrivateClouds` call. Provide this to retrieve the subsequent page. When paginating, all other parameters provided to `ListPrivateClouds` must match the call that provided the page token.
