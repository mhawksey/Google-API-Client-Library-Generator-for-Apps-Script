|---|---|---|---|
| `params.name` | `string` | Yes | The name of the operation resource to be deleted. |

### `projects.locations.privateClouds`

#### `projects.locations.privateClouds.list()`

Lists `PrivateCloud` resources in a given project and location.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.parent` | `string` | Yes | Required. The resource name of the private cloud to be queried for clusters. Resource names are schemeless URIs that follow the conventions in https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names. For example: `projects/my-project/locations/us-central1-a` |
| `params.pageSize` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of private clouds to return in one page. The service may return fewer than this value. The maximum value is coerced to 1000. The default value of this field is 500. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | A page token, received from a previous `ListPrivateClouds` call. Provide this to retrieve the subsequent page. When paginating, all other parameters provided to `ListPrivateClouds` must match the call that provided the page token. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that matches resources returned in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be `=`, `!=`, `>`, or `<`. For example, if you are filtering a list of private clouds, you can exclude the ones named `example-pc` by specifying `name != "example-pc"`. You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `networkConfig.managementCidr = "192.168.0.0/24"` to include private clouds only if they have a matching address in their network configuration. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (name = "example-pc") (createTime > "2021-04-12T08:15:10.40Z") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.

#### `projects.locations.privateClouds.patch()`

Modifies a `PrivateCloud` resource. Only the following fields can be updated: `description`. Only fields specified in `updateMask` are applied. During operation processing, the resource is temporarily in the `ACTIVE` state before the operation fully completes. For that period of time, you can't update the resource. Use the operation status to determine when the processing fully completes.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.name` | `string` | Yes | Output only. Identifier. The resource name of this private cloud. Resource names are schemeless URIs that follow the conventions in https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names.

#### `projects.locations.privateClouds.delete()`

Schedules a `PrivateCloud` resource for deletion. A `PrivateCloud` resource scheduled for deletion has `PrivateCloud.state` set to `DELETED` and `expireTime` set to the time when deletion is final and can no longer be reversed. The delete operation is marked as done as soon as the `PrivateCloud` is successfully scheduled for deletion (this also applies when `delayHours` is set to zero), and the operation is not kept in pending state until `PrivateCloud` is purged. `PrivateCloud` can be restored using `UndeletePrivateCloud` method before the `expireTime` elapses. When `expireTime` is reached, deletion is final and all private cloud resources are irreversibly removed and billing stops. During the final removal process, `PrivateCloud.state` is set to `PURGING`. `PrivateCloud` can be polled using standard `GET` method for the whole period of deletion and purging. It will not be returned only when it is completely purged.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |

| `params.name` | `string` | Yes | Required. The resource name of the private cloud to delete. Resource names are schemeless URIs that follow the conventions in https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names. For example: `projects/my-project/locations/us-central1-a/privateClouds/my-cloud` |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | Optional. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.force` | `boolean` | No | Optional. If set to true, cascade delete is enabled and all children of this private cloud resource are also deleted. When this flag is set to false, the private cloud will not be deleted if there are any children other than the management cluster. The management cluster is always deleted. |
| `params.delayHours` | `integer` | No | Optional. Time delay of the deletion specified in hours. The default value is `3`. Specifying a non-zero value for this field changes the value of `PrivateCloud.state` to `DELETED` and sets `expire_time` to the planned deletion time. Deletion can be cancelled before `expire_time` elapses using VmwareEngine.UndeletePrivateCloud. Specifying a value of `0` for this field instead begins the deletion process and ceases billing immediately. During the final deletion process, the value of `PrivateCloud.state` becomes `PURGING`. |

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.name` | `string` | Yes | Output only. The resource name of this binding. Resource names are schemeless URIs that follow the conventions in https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names. For example: `projects/my-project/locations/us-central1-a/privateClouds/my-cloud/managementDnsZoneBindings/my-management-dns-zone-binding` |
| `params.updateMask` | `string` | No | Required. Field mask is used to specify the fields to be overwritten in the `ManagementDnsZoneBinding` resource by the update. The fields specified in the `update_mask` are relative to the resource, not the full request. A field will be overwritten if it is in the mask. If the user does not provide a mask then all fields will be overwritten. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | Optional. A request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server guarantees that a request doesn't result in creation of duplicate commitments for at least 60 minutes. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if the original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

|---|---|---|---|
| `params.parent` | `string` | Yes | Required. The resource name of the location to create the new network peering in. This value is always `global`, because `NetworkPeering` is a global resource. Resource names are schemeless URIs that follow the conventions in https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names. For example: `projects/my-project/locations/global` |
| `params.networkPeeringId` | `string` | No | Required. The user-provided identifier of the new `NetworkPeering`. This identifier must be unique among `NetworkPeering` resources within the parent and becomes the final token in the name URI. The identifier must meet the following requirements: * Only contains 1-63 alphanumeric characters and hyphens * Begins with an alphabetical character * Ends with a non-hyphen character * Not formatted as a UUID * Complies with [RFC 1034](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1034) (section 3.5) |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | Optional. A request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server guarantees that a request doesn't result in creation of duplicate commitments for at least 60 minutes. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
