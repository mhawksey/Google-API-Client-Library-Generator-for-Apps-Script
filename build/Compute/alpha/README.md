## API Reference

### `diskTypes`

#### `diskTypes.get()`

Returns the specified disk type.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of the zone for this request. |
| `params.diskType` | `string` | Yes | Name of the disk type to return. |

#### `diskTypes.list()`

Retrieves a list of disk types available to the specified
project.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of the zone for this request. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |

#### `diskTypes.aggregatedList()`

Retrieves an aggregated list of disk types.

To prevent failure, it is recommended that you set the
`returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which
aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,

request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | Name of the zone scoping this request. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |

| `params.targetInstance` | `string` | Yes | Name of the TargetInstance resource to return. |

#### `targetInstances.aggregatedList()`

Retrieves an aggregated list of target instances.

To prevent failure, Google recommends that you set the
`returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get

expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first
character will be a lowercase letter, and all following characters can be
a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot
be a dash. |

#### `regionRecoverableSnapshots.list()`

Retrieves the list of RecoverableSnapshot resources contained within
the specified region.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region for this request. |

#### `regionRecoverableSnapshots.delete()`

Deletes the specified RecoverableSnapshot. Deleting a recoverable snapshot
will delete the underlying PD snapshot and is irreversible.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region for this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.recoverableSnapshot` | `string` | Yes | Name of the recoverable Snapshot resource to delete. |

| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |

the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.guestFlush` | `boolean` | No | [Input Only] Whether to attempt an application consistent snapshot by
informing the OS to prepare for the snapshot process. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `disks.list()`

Retrieves a list of persistent disks contained within
the specified zone.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of the zone for this request. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |

#### `disks.resize()`

request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation

|---|---|---|---|
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |

request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.rolloutPlan` | `string` | Yes | Name of the RolloutPlan resource to delete. |

(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

#### `httpHealthChecks.list()`

Retrieves the list of HttpHealthCheck resources available to the specified
project.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always

#### `sslPolicies.list()`

Lists all the SSL policies that have been configured for the specified
project.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

`returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Name of the project scoping this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which
aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |

#### `sslPolicies.delete()`

only if it is not in use by any TargetHttpsProxy or TargetSslProxy
resources.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |

that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |

### `interconnectGroups`

#### `interconnectGroups.getOperationalStatus()`

Replaces any existing policy.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.resource` | `string` | Yes | Name or id of the resource for this request. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `interconnectGroups.list()`

Lists the InterconnectGroups for a project in the given scope.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |

| `params.parentId` | `string` | No | Parent ID for this request. The ID can be either be "folders/[FOLDER_ID]"
if the parent is a folder or "organizations/[ORGANIZATION_ID]" if the
parent is an organization. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results

| `params.resource` | `string` | Yes | Name or id of the resource for this request. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `firewallPolicies.cloneRules()`

Copies rules to the specified firewall policy.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.sourceFirewallPolicy` | `string` | No | The firewall policy from which to copy rules. |
| `params.firewallPolicy` | `string` | Yes | Name of the firewall policy to update. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |

#### `firewallPolicies.getAssociation()`

Gets an association with the specified name.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |

| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.priority` | `integer` | No | The priority of the rule to patch. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

### `zones`

#### `zones.list()`

Retrieves the list of Zone resources available to the specified project.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |

#### `zones.get()`

request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get

| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |

single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |

#### `targetHttpProxies.list()`

### `regionSnapshots`

#### `regionSnapshots.delete()`

Deletes the specified Snapshot resource. Keep in mind that deleting
a single snapshot might not necessarily delete all the data on that
snapshot. If any data on the snapshot that is marked for deletion is
needed for subsequent snapshots, the data will be moved to the next
corresponding snapshot.

For more information, seeDeleting
snapshots.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|

request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |

#### `regionSnapshots.updateKmsKey()`

Rotates the customer-managed
encryption key to the latest version for the specified snapshot.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |

#### `regionSnapshots.list()`

Retrieves the list of Snapshot resources contained within
the specified region.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region for this request. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |

the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |

#### `nodeTemplates.list()`

Retrieves a list of node templates available to the specified
project.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | The name of the region for this request. |

#### `nodeTemplates.testIamPermissions()`

| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |

To prevent failure, Google recommends that you set the
`returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |

| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |

request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `regionCompositeHealthChecks.patch()`

| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `regionCompositeHealthChecks.list()`

Lists the CompositeHealthChecks for a project in the given region.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |

after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Name of the project scoping this request. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which
aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |

If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |

### `snapshotGroups`

#### `snapshotGroups.insert()`

Creates a snapshot group in the specified project using the data included
in the request.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.snapshotGroup` | `string` | Yes | Name of the SnapshotGroup resource to delete. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |

|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,

Creates a Router resource in the specified project and region using
the data included in the request.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region for this request. |

| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.router` | `string` | Yes | Name of the Router resource where Route Policy is defined. |
| `params.policy` | `string` | No | The Policy name for this request. Name must conform to RFC1035 |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |

#### `routers.list()`

Retrieves a list of Router resources available to the specified project.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region for this request. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |

| `params.peer` | `string` | No | (Required) limit results to the BGP peer with the given name.
Name should conform to RFC1035. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.router` | `string` | Yes | Name or id of the resource for this request.
Name should conform to RFC1035. |
| `params.policyApplied` | `boolean` | No | When true, the method returns post-policy routes. Otherwise, it returns
pre-policy routes. |
| `params.destinationPrefix` | `string` | No | Limit results to destinations that are subnets of this CIDR range |
| `params.addressFamily` | `string` | No | (Required) limit results to this address family (either IPv4 or IPv6) |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.routeType` | `string` | No | (Required) limit results to this type of route (either LEARNED or
ADVERTISED) |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |

#### `routers.patch()`

Patches the specified Router resource with the data included in the
request. This method supportsPATCH
semantics and usesJSON merge
patch format and processing rules.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.router` | `string` | Yes | Name of the Router resource to patch. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region for this request. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |

#### `vpnGateways.aggregatedList()`

Retrieves an aggregated list of VPN gateways.

To prevent failure, Google recommends that you set the
`returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which
aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |

`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of the zone for this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |

#### `nodeGroups.addNodes()`

simulation. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.resource` | `string` | Yes | Name or id of the resource for this request. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of the zone for this request. |

#### `nodeGroups.get()`

Returns the specified NodeGroup. Get a list of available NodeGroups
by making a list() request.
Note: the "nodes" field should not be used. Use nodeGroups.listNodes
instead.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of the zone for this request. |
| `params.nodeGroup` | `string` | Yes | Name of the node group to return. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |

#### `nodeGroups.aggregatedList()`

Retrieves an aggregated list of node groups.
Note: use nodeGroups.listNodes for more details about each group.

To prevent failure, Google recommends that you set the
`returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which
aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |

#### `nodeGroups.listNodes()`

Lists nodes in the node group.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |

| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of the zone for this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |

#### `networkEndpointGroups.detachNetworkEndpoints()`

Detach a list of network endpoints from the specified network endpoint
group.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of the zone where
the network endpoint group is located. It should comply with RFC1035. |

list of included network endpoints. It should comply with RFC1035. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of the zone where
the network endpoint group is located. It should comply with RFC1035. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the

request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

with an error code. |
| `params.subnetName` | `string` | No | (Optional) Subnetwork name filter. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.ownerProjects` | `string` | No | (Optional) Project IDs filter, example: "project-1,project-2". |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |

| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `instanceGroups.list()`

Retrieves the list of zonal instance group resources contained within the
specified zone.

For managed instance groups, use theinstanceGroupManagers
or regionInstanceGroupManagers
methods instead.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of thezone
where the instance group is located. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |

#### `instanceGroups.get()`

Returns the specified zonal instance group. Get a list of available zonal
instance groups by making a list() request.

For managed instance groups, use theinstanceGroupManagers
or regionInstanceGroupManagers
methods instead.

|---|---|---|---|
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of the zone
where the instance group is located. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.instanceGroup` | `string` | Yes | The name of the instance group. |

#### `instanceGroups.aggregatedList()`

Retrieves the list of instance groups and sorts them by zone.

To prevent failure, Google recommends that you set the
`returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a

| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |

publicly-available licenses, use this method to make a request to the
respective image project, such as debian-cloud orwindows-cloud.
 *Caution* This resource is intended
for use only by third-party partners who are creatingCloud Marketplace
images.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |

#### `licenses.delete()`

Deletes the specified license.
 *Caution* This resource is intended
for use only by third-party partners who are creatingCloud Marketplace

|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.license` | `string` | Yes | Name of the license resource to delete. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |

unless you run recreateInstances, runapplyUpdatesToInstances, or set the group'supdatePolicy.type to PROACTIVE.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |

#### `instanceGroupManagers.suspendInstances()`

Flags the specified instances in the managed instance group to be
immediately suspended. You can only specify instances that are running in
this request. This method reduces thetargetSize and increases the targetSuspendedSize
of the managed instance group by the number of instances that you suspend.
The suspendInstances operation is marked DONE if
the suspendInstances request is successful. The underlying
actions take additional time. You must separately verify the status of theSUSPENDING action with thelistmanagedinstances
method.

If the standbyPolicy.initialDelaySec field is set, the group
delays suspension of the instances until initialDelaySec have
passed from instance.creationTimestamp (that is, when the
instance was created). This delay gives your application time to
set itself up and initialize on the instance. If more thaninitialDelaySec seconds have passed sinceinstance.creationTimestamp when this method is called, there
will be zero delay.

If the group is part of a backend
service that has enabled
connection draining, it can take up to 60 seconds after the connection
draining duration has elapsed before the VM instance is suspended.

Suspended instances can be resumed using the resumeInstances
method.

You can specify a maximum of 1000 instances with this method per request.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of thezone where the managed
instance group is located. |

managed instance group. Abandoning an instance does not delete the
instance, but it does remove the instance from any target pools that are
applied by the managed instance group. This method reduces thetargetSize of the managed instance group by the
number of instances that you abandon. This operation is marked asDONE when the action is scheduled even if the instances have
not yet been removed from the group. You must separately verify the
status of the abandoning action with thelistmanagedinstances
method.

If the group is part of a backend
service that has enabled
connection draining, it can take up to 60 seconds after the connection
draining duration has elapsed before the VM instance is removed or deleted.

You can specify a maximum of 1000 instances with this method per request.

#### `instanceGroupManagers.deleteInstances()`

Flags the specified instances in the managed instance group for immediate
deletion. The instances are also removed from any target
pools of which they were a member. This method reduces thetargetSize of the managed instance group by the number of
instances that you delete. This operation is marked as DONE
when the action is scheduled even if the instances are still being deleted.
You must separately verify the status of the deleting action
with thelistmanagedinstances
method.

If the group is part of a backend
service that has enabled
connection draining, it can take up to 60 seconds after the connection
draining duration has elapsed before the VM instance is removed or deleted.

in the request.
This operation is marked as DONE when the group is patched
even if the instances in the group are still in the process of being
patched. You must separately verify the status of the individual instances
with thelistManagedInstances
method. This method supportsPATCH
semantics and uses theJSON merge
patch format and processing rules.

If you update your group to specify a new template or instance
configuration, it's possible that your intended specification for each VM
in the group is different from the current state of that VM. To learn how
to apply an updated configuration to the VMs in a MIG, seeUpdating instances in

#### `instanceGroupManagers.resizeAdvanced()`

Resizes the managed instance group with advanced configuration options like
disabling creation retries. This is an extended version of theresize method.

If you increase the size of the instance group, the group creates new
instances using the current instance template. If you decrease the size,
the group deletes instances. The resize operation is markedDONE when the resize actions are scheduled even if the group
has not yet added or deleted any instances. You must separately
verify the status of the creating,creatingWithoutRetries, or deleting actions with
the get

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.instanceGroupManager` | `string` | Yes | The name of the managed instance group. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `instanceGroupManagers.aggregatedList()`

Retrieves the list of managed instance groups and groups them by zone.

To prevent failure, Google recommends that you set the
`returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which
aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |

even if the instances in the group have not yet been updated. You must
separately verify the status of the individual instances with thelistManagedInstances
method.

If you update your group to specify a new template or instance
configuration, it's possible that your intended specification for each VM
in the group is different from the current state of that VM. To learn how
to apply an updated configuration to the VMs in a MIG, seeUpdating instances in

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

#### `instanceGroupManagers.listManagedInstances()`

Lists all of the instances in the managed instance group. Each instance
in the list has a currentAction, which indicates the action
that the managed instance group is performing on the instance. For example,
if the group is still creating an instance, the currentAction
is CREATING. If a previous action failed, the
list displays the errors for that failed action. The orderBy
query parameter is not supported. The `pageToken` query parameter is
supported only if the group's `listManagedInstancesResults` field is set

#### `instanceGroupManagers.resize()`

Resizes the managed instance group. If you increase the size, the group
creates new instances using the current instance template. If you decrease
the size, the group deletes instances. The resize operation is markedDONE when the resize actions are scheduled even if the group
has not yet added or deleted any instances. You must separately
verify the status of the creating or deleting
actions with thelistmanagedinstances
method.

When resizing down, the instance group arbitrarily chooses the order in
which VMs are deleted. The group takes into account some VM attributes when
making the selection including:

+ The status of the VM instance.
+ The health of the VM instance.
+ The instance template version the VM is based on.
+ For regional managed instance groups, the location of the VM instance.

This list is subject to change.

If the group is part of a backend
service that has enabled
connection draining, it can take up to 60 seconds after the connection
draining duration has elapsed before the VM instance is removed or deleted.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of thezone where the managed

| `params.size` | `integer` | Yes | The number of running instances that the managed instance group should
maintain at any given time. The group automatically adds or removes
instances to maintain the number of instances specified by this parameter. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This

#### `instanceGroupManagers.startInstances()`

Flags the specified instances in the managed instance group to be
started. This method increases thetargetSize and decreases the targetStoppedSize
of the managed instance group by the number of instances that you start.
The startInstances operation is marked DONE if
the startInstances request is successful. The underlying
actions take additional time. You must separately verify the status of theSTARTING action with thelistmanagedinstances
method.

In this request, you can only specify instances that are stopped. For
example, if an instance was previously stopped using the stopInstances
method, it can be started using the startInstances method.

If a health check is attached to the managed instance group, the specified
instances will be verified as healthy after they are started.

You can specify a maximum of 1000 instances with this method per request.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the

#### `instanceGroupManagers.setTargetPools()`

Modifies the target pools to which all instances in this managed instance
group are assigned. The target pools automatically apply to all of the
instances in the managed instance group. This operation is markedDONE when you make the request even if the instances have not
yet been added to their target pools. The change might take some time to
apply to all of the instances in the group depending on the size of the
group.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of thezone where the managed
instance group is located. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so

instance group. The filter and orderBy query
parameters are not supported.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.instanceGroupManager` | `string` | Yes | The name of the managed instance group.
It must be a string that meets the requirements in RFC1035, or an

(?:[a-z](?:[-a-z0-9]{0,61}[a-z0-9])?)|1-9{0,19}. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case

are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |

#### `instanceGroupManagers.resumeInstances()`

Flags the specified instances in the managed instance group to be
resumed. This method increases thetargetSize and decreases the targetSuspendedSize
of the managed instance group by the number of instances that you resume.
The resumeInstances operation is marked DONE if
the resumeInstances request is successful. The underlying
actions take additional time. You must separately verify the status of theRESUMING action with thelistmanagedinstances
method.

In this request, you can only specify instances that are suspended. For
example, if an instance was previously suspended using the suspendInstances
method, it can be resumed using the resumeInstances method.

If a health check is attached to the managed instance group, the specified
instances will be verified as healthy after they are resumed.

You can specify a maximum of 1000 instances with this method per request.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.instanceGroupManager` | `string` | Yes | The name of the managed instance group. |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of thezone where the managed
instance group is located. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `instanceGroupManagers.recreateInstances()`

Flags the specified VM instances in the managed instance group to be
immediately recreated. Each instance is recreated using the group's current
configuration. This operation is marked as DONE when the flag
is set even if the instances have not yet been recreated. You must
separately verify the status of each instance by checking itscurrentAction field; for more information, see Checking
the status of managed instances.

If the group is part of a backend
service that has enabled
connection draining, it can take up to 60 seconds after the connection
draining duration has elapsed before the VM instance is removed or deleted.

You can specify a maximum of 1000 instances with this method per request.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of thezone where the managed
instance group is located. |
| `params.instanceGroupManager` | `string` | Yes | The name of the managed instance group. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `instanceGroupManagers.listPerInstanceConfigs()`

Lists all of the per-instance configurations defined for the managed
instance group. The orderBy query parameter is not supported.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.instanceGroupManager` | `string` | Yes | The name of the managed instance group. It should conform to RFC1035. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of thezone
where the managed instance group is located.
It should conform to RFC1035. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |

#### `instanceGroupManagers.delete()`

Deletes the specified managed instance group and all of the instances
in that group. Note that the instance group must not belong to a
backend service. Read
Deleting an instance group for more information.

|---|---|---|---|
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of thezone where the managed
instance group is located. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.instanceGroupManager` | `string` | Yes | The name of the managed instance group to delete. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |

#### `regionZones.list()`

Retrieves the list of Zone resources under the specific region available to
the specified project.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Region for this request. |

scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an

must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region for this request. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |

| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |

#### `targetHttpsProxies.list()`

Retrieves the list of TargetHttpsProxy resources
available to the specified project.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation

of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |

#### `targetHttpsProxies.setSslCertificates()`

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Name of the project scoping this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case

### `diskSettings`

#### `diskSettings.patch()`

Patch Zonal Disk Settings

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of the zone for this request. |
| `params.updateMask` | `string` | No | update_mask indicates fields to be updated as part of this request. |

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `globalPublicDelegatedPrefixes.list()`

Lists the global PublicDelegatedPrefixes for a project.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |

#### `globalPublicDelegatedPrefixes.delete()`

Deletes the specified global PublicDelegatedPrefix.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.publicDelegatedPrefix` | `string` | Yes | Name of the PublicDelegatedPrefix resource to delete. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |

### `regions`

#### `regions.list()`

Retrieves the list of region resources available to the specified project.

To decrease latency for this method, you can optionally omit any unneeded
information from the response by using a field mask. This practice is
especially recommended for unused quota information
(the `items.quotas` field).
To exclude one or more fields, set your request's `fields` query parameter
to only include the fields you need. For example, to only include the `id`
and `selfLink` fields, add the query parameter `?fields=id,selfLink` to
your request.

This method fails if the quota information is unavailable for the region
and if the organization policy constraint
compute.requireBasicQuotaInResponse is enforced. This
constraint, when enforced, disables the fail-open behaviour when quota
information (the `items.quotas` field) is unavailable for the region.
It is recommended to use the default setting
for the constraint unless your application requires the fail-closed
behaviour for this method.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most

#### `regionNotificationEndpoints.aggregatedList()`

Retrieves the list of all NotificationEndpoint resources,
regional and global, available to the specified project.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,

types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `forwardingRules.patch()`

Updates the specified forwarding rule with the data included in the
request. This method supportsPATCH
semantics and uses theJSON merge
patch format and processing rules. Currently, you can only
patch the network_tier field.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.forwardingRule` | `string` | Yes | Name of the ForwardingRule resource to patch. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `forwardingRules.list()`

Retrieves a list of ForwardingRule resources available to the specified
project and region.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |

#### `forwardingRules.get()`

Returns the specified ForwardingRule resource.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |

| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `forwardingRules.aggregatedList()`

Retrieves an aggregated list of forwarding rules.

To prevent failure, it is recommended that you set the
`returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which
aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |

|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region of this request. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |

#### `publicDelegatedPrefixes.patch()`

| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region for this request. |
| `params.publicDelegatedPrefix` | `string` | Yes | Name of the PublicDelegatedPrefix resource to patch. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `publicDelegatedPrefixes.aggregatedList()`

Lists all PublicDelegatedPrefix resources owned by the specific project
across all scopes.

To prevent failure, Google recommends that you set the
`returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which
aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Name of the project scoping this request. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |

#### `targetPools.aggregatedList()`

Retrieves an aggregated list of target pools.

To prevent failure, Google recommends that you set the
`returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which
aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |

#### `targetPools.get()`

the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |

### `images`

#### `images.list()`

Retrieves the list of custom images
available to the specified project. Custom images are images you
create that belong to your project. This method does not
get any images that belong to other projects, including publicly-available
images, like Debian 8. If you want to get a list of publicly-available
images, use this method to make a request to the respective image project,
such as debian-cloud or windows-cloud.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.zone` | `string` | No | The zone query parameter. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most

| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |

request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `regionDisks.createSnapshot()`

Creates a snapshot of a specified persistent disk. For regular snapshot
creation, consider using snapshots.insert
instead, as that method supports more features, such as creating snapshots
in a project different from the source disk project.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region for this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.disk` | `string` | Yes | Name of the regional persistent disk to snapshot. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.guestFlush` | `boolean` | No | [Input Only] Specifies to create an application consistent snapshot by
informing the OS to prepare for the snapshot process. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | The name of the region for this request. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `regionDisks.get()`

Returns a specified regional persistent disk.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.disk` | `string` | Yes | Name of the regional persistent disk to return. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region for this request. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |

#### `regionDisks.list()`

Retrieves the list of persistent disks contained within
the specified region.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region for this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:

can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |

aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

|---|---|---|---|
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.recoverableSnapshot` | `string` | Yes | Name of the recoverable resource to recover |

that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `globalAddresses.move()`

Moves the specified address resource from one project to another project.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.address` | `string` | Yes | Name of the address resource to move. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Source project ID which the Address is moved from. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `globalAddresses.setLabels()`

Sets the labels on a GlobalAddress. To learn more about labels, read theLabeling
Resources documentation.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.resource` | `string` | Yes | Name or id of the resource for this request. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `globalAddresses.list()`

Retrieves a list of global addresses.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |

| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |

|---|---|---|---|
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which
aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |

scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:

By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which
aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |

#### `securityPolicies.addRule()`

Inserts a rule into a security policy.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.securityPolicy` | `string` | Yes | Name of the security policy to update. |
| `params.validateOnly` | `boolean` | No | If true, the request will not be committed. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `securityPolicies.list()`

List all the policies that have been configured for the specified project.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |

#### `regionNetworkPolicies.list()`

Lists all the policies that have been configured for the specified project
in the given region.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get

#### `regionNetworkPolicies.delete()`

Deletes the specified policy.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |

`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |

| `params.targetHttpsProxy` | `string` | Yes | Name of the TargetHttpsProxy to set a URL map for. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This

`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.crossSiteNetwork` | `string` | Yes |  |

#### `wireGroups.get()`

Gets the specified wire group resource in the given scope.

#### `regionOperations.list()`

Retrieves a list of Operation resources contained within
the specified region.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region for this request. |

#### `regionOperations.delete()`

Deletes the specified region-specific Operations resource.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.operation` | `string` | Yes | Name of the Operations resource to delete, or its unique numeric
identifier. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region for this request. |

#### `regionOperations.wait()`

Waits for the specified Operation resource to return as `DONE`
or for the request to approach the 2 minute deadline, and retrieves the
specified Operation resource. This method differs from the
`GET` method in that it waits for no more than the default
deadline (2 minutes) and then returns the current state of the operation,
which might be `DONE` or still in progress.

This method is called on a best-effort basis. Specifically:
   
   
    - In uncommon cases, when the server is overloaded, the request might
    return before the default deadline is reached, or might return after zero
    seconds.
   - If the default deadline is reached, there is no guarantee that the
    operation is actually done when the method returns. Be prepared to retry
    if the operation is not `DONE`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.operation` | `string` | Yes | Name of the Operations resource to return, or its unique numeric
identifier. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region for this request. |

### `storagePools`

#### `storagePools.delete()`

Deletes the specified storage pool. Deleting a storagePool
removes its data permanently and is irreversible. However, deleting a
storagePool does not delete any snapshots previously
made from the storagePool. You must separately delete
snapshots.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.storagePool` | `string` | Yes | Name of the storage pool to delete. |

the specified zone.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of the zone for this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:

`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR

(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |

| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `storagePools.aggregatedList()`

Retrieves an aggregated list of storage pools.

To prevent failure, Google recommends that you set the
`returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which
aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |

The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |

can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |

### `backendServices`

#### `backendServices.insert()`

Creates a BackendService resource in the specified project using
the data included in the request. For more information, see
Backend services overview.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `backendServices.addSignedUrlKey()`

Adds a key for validating requests with signed URLs for this backend
service.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.backendService` | `string` | Yes | Name of the BackendService resource to which the Signed URL Key should be
added. The name should conform to RFC1035. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `backendServices.aggregatedList()`

Retrieves the list of all BackendService resources, regional and global,
available to the specified project.

To prevent failure, it is recommended that you set the
`returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Name of the project scoping this request. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which
aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |

#### `backendServices.getEffectiveSecurityPolicies()`

If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

#### `regionNetworkFirewallPolicies.list()`

Lists all the network firewall policies that have been configured
for the specified project in the given region.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID
so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |

### `healthChecks`

#### `healthChecks.list()`

Retrieves the list of HealthCheck resources available to the specified
project.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |

#### `healthChecks.patch()`

Updates a HealthCheck resource in the specified project using the data
included in the request. This method supportsPATCH
semantics and uses theJSON merge
patch format and processing rules.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.healthCheck` | `string` | Yes | Name of the HealthCheck resource to patch. |

|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.healthCheck` | `string` | Yes | Name of the HealthCheck resource to return. |

#### `healthChecks.aggregatedList()`

Retrieves the list of all HealthCheck resources, regional and global,
available to the specified project.

To prevent failure, Google recommends that you set the
`returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which
aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Name of the project scoping this request. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |

#### `healthChecks.update()`

Updates a HealthCheck resource in the specified project using the data
included in the request.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so

| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | The name of the region where
the network endpoint group is located. It should comply with
RFC1035. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
end_interface: MixerMutationRequestBuilder |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.networkEndpointGroup` | `string` | Yes | The name of the network endpoint group you are detaching network
endpoints from. It should comply with RFC1035. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `regionNetworkEndpointGroups.list()`

Retrieves the list of regional network endpoint groups available to the
specified project in the given region.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | The name of theregion
where the network endpoint group is located. It should comply with RFC1035. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |

#### `regionNetworkEndpointGroups.listNetworkEndpoints()`

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | The name of theregion

#### `crossSiteNetworks.list()`

Lists the cross-site networks for a project in the given scope.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |

#### `interconnectAttachments.aggregatedList()`

Retrieves an aggregated list of interconnect attachments.

To prevent failure, Google recommends that you set the
`returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which
aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |

#### `interconnectAttachments.list()`

Retrieves the list of interconnect attachments contained within
the specified region.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |

| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request.
It must be a string that meets the requirements in RFC1035. |

(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |

### `reservationSubBlocks`

#### `reservationSubBlocks.reportFaulty()`

Allows customers to report a faulty subBlock.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.reservationSubBlock` | `string` | Yes | The name of the reservation subBlock.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.parentName` | `string` | Yes | The name of the parent reservation and parent block. In the format of
reservations/{reservation_name}/reservationBlocks/{reservation_block_name} |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | Name of the zone for this request. Zone name should conform to RFC1035. |

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |

#### `reservations.aggregatedList()`

Retrieves an aggregated list of reservations.

To prevent failure, it is recommended that you set the
`returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation

| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |

| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,

include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |

#### `reservations.list()`

A list of all the reservations that have been configured for the
specified project in specified zone.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | Name of the zone for this request. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |

#### `reservations.delete()`

|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be

request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be

with an error code. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:

By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |

of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |

#### `futureReservations.delete()`

Deletes the specified future reservation.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.futureReservation` | `string` | Yes | Name of the future reservation to retrieve. Name should conform to RFC1035. |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | Name of the zone for this request. Name should conform to RFC1035. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |

#### `futureReservations.list()`

A list of all the future reservations that have been configured for the
specified project in specified zone.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | Name of the zone for this request. Name should conform to RFC1035. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |

Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case

you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |

#### `globalOperations.wait()`

Waits for the specified Operation resource to return as `DONE`
or for the request to approach the 2 minute deadline, and retrieves the
specified Operation resource. This method differs from the
`GET` method in that it waits for no more than the default
deadline (2 minutes) and then returns the current state of the operation,
which might be `DONE` or still in progress.

This method is called on a best-effort basis. Specifically:
   
   
    - In uncommon cases, when the server is overloaded, the request might
    return before the default deadline is reached, or might return after zero
    seconds.
   - If the default deadline is reached, there is no guarantee that the
    operation is actually done when the method returns. Be prepared to retry
    if the operation is not `DONE`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.operation` | `string` | Yes | Name of the Operations resource to return, or its unique numeric
identifier. |

#### `globalOperations.aggregatedList()`

To prevent failure, Google recommends that you set the
`returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |

| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,

| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |

### `globalNetworkEndpointGroups`

must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |

#### `zoneQueuedResources.insert()`

Creates a QueuedResource.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | Name of the zone for this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be a valid UUID with
the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `zoneQueuedResources.cancel()`

Cancels a QueuedResource. Only a resource in ACCEPTED state may be
cancelled.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same

| `params.queuedResource` | `string` | Yes | Name of the QueuedResource to cancel. |

#### `zoneQueuedResources.aggregatedList()`

Retrieves an aggregated list of all of the queued resources in a project
across all zones.

To prevent failure, Google recommends that you set the
`returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which
aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |

#### `zoneQueuedResources.get()`

#### `zoneQueuedResources.delete()`

Deletes a QueuedResource. For a QueuedResource in ACCEPTED state, call
cancel on the resource before deleting, to make sure no VMs have been
provisioned and may require cleaning up. For a QueuedResource in
PROVISIONING state the request to delete is registered for execution
following the provisioning.

#### `publicAdvertisedPrefixes.list()`

Lists the PublicAdvertisedPrefixes for a project.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |

### `organizationSecurityPolicies`

#### `organizationSecurityPolicies.patch()`

Patches the specified policy with the data included in the request.

Use this API to modify Cloud Armor policies. Previously, alpha and beta

| `params.updateMask` | `string` | No | Indicates fields to be cleared as part of this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported

single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |

#### `organizationSecurityPolicies.delete()`

Deletes the specified policy.

Use this API to remove Cloud Armor policies. Previously, alpha and beta
versions of this API were used to remove firewall policies. This usage is
now disabled for most organizations. Use firewallPolicies.delete instead.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |

#### `regionInstantSnapshotGroups.list()`

retrieves the list of InstantSnapshotGroup resources contained within
the specified region.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | The name of the region for this request. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |

### `targetTcpProxies`

#### `targetTcpProxies.setProxyHeader()`

Changes the ProxyHeaderType for TargetTcpProxy.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.targetTcpProxy` | `string` | Yes | Name of the TargetTcpProxy resource whose ProxyHeader is to be set. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `targetTcpProxies.aggregatedList()`

Retrieves the list of all TargetTcpProxy resources, regional and global,
available to the specified project.

To prevent failure, Google recommends that you set the
`returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Name of the project scoping this request. |
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which
aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |

request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |

#### `instances.list()`

Retrieves the list of instances contained within
the specified zone.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of the zone for this request. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.view` | `string` | No | View of the instance. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |

#### `instances.aggregatedList()`

Retrieves an aggregated list of all of the instances in your project
across all regions and zones.

The performance of this method degrades when a filter is specified on a
project that has a very large number of instances.

To prevent failure, Google recommends that you set the
`returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which
aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |

#### `instances.updateShieldedVmConfig()`

Updates the Shielded VM config for a VM instance. You can

request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |

For more information, readViewing
referrers to VM instances.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.instance` | `string` | Yes | Name of the target instance scoping this request, or '-' if the
request should span over all instances in the container. |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of the zone for this request. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |

### `nodeTypes`

#### `nodeTypes.aggregatedList()`

Retrieves an aggregated list of node types.

To prevent failure, Google recommends that you set the
`returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which
aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |

with an error code. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |

#### `regionSslPolicies.testIamPermissions()`

Returns permissions that a caller has on the specified resource.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.resource` | `string` | Yes | Name or id of the resource for this request. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | The name of the region for this request. |

that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |

### `regionInstanceGroupManagers`

#### `regionInstanceGroupManagers.adoptInstances()`

Flags the specified instances to be adopted to the managed instance
group. Adopting an instance does not change the instance status, but it
adds the instance to any target pools that are applied by the managed
instance group. This method increases the targetSize of the managed
instance group by the number of instances that you adopt. This operation
is marked as DONE when the action is scheduled even if the instances have
not been adopted to the group yet. You must separately verify the status
of the adopting action with the listManagedInstances method.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request. It should conform to RFC1035. |

| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `regionInstanceGroupManagers.resumeInstances()`

Flags the specified instances in the managed instance group to be
resumed. This method increases thetargetSize and decreases the targetSuspendedSize
of the managed instance group by the number of instances that you resume.
The resumeInstances operation is marked DONE if
the resumeInstances request is successful. The underlying
actions take additional time. You must separately verify the status of theRESUMING action with thelistmanagedinstances
method.

In this request, you can only specify instances that are suspended. For
example, if an instance was previously suspended using the suspendInstances
method, it can be resumed using the resumeInstances method.

If a health check is attached to the managed instance group, the specified
instances will be verified as healthy after they are resumed.

You can specify a maximum of 1000 instances with this method per request.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.instanceGroupManager` | `string` | Yes | Name of the managed instance group. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request. |
| `params.instanceGroupManager` | `string` | Yes | Name of the managed instance group to return. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |

#### `regionInstanceGroupManagers.abandonInstances()`

Flags the specified instances to be immediately removed from the managed
instance group. Abandoning an instance does not delete the
instance, but it does remove the instance from any target pools that are
applied by the managed instance group. This method reduces thetargetSize of the managed instance group by the
number of instances that you abandon. This operation is marked asDONE when the action is scheduled even if the instances have
not yet been removed from the group. You must separately verify the
status of the abandoning action with thelistmanagedinstances
method.

If the group is part of a backend
service that has enabled
connection draining, it can take up to 60 seconds after the connection
draining duration has elapsed before the VM instance is removed or deleted.

You can specify a maximum of 1000 instances with this method per request.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same

| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `regionInstanceGroupManagers.suspendInstances()`

Flags the specified instances in the managed instance group to be
immediately suspended. You can only specify instances that are running in
this request. This method reduces thetargetSize and increases the targetSuspendedSize
of the managed instance group by the number of instances that you suspend.
The suspendInstances operation is marked DONE if
the suspendInstances request is successful. The underlying
actions take additional time. You must separately verify the status of theSUSPENDING action with thelistmanagedinstances
method.

If the standbyPolicy.initialDelaySec field is set, the group
delays suspension of the instances until initialDelaySec have
passed from instance.creationTimestamp (that is, when the
instance was created). This delay gives your application time to
set itself up and initialize on the instance. If more thaninitialDelaySec seconds have passed sinceinstance.creationTimestamp when this method is called, there
will be zero delay.

If the group is part of a backend
service that has enabled
connection draining, it can take up to 60 seconds after the connection
draining duration has elapsed before the VM instance is suspended.

Suspended instances can be resumed using the resumeInstances
method.

You can specify a maximum of 1000 instances with this method per request.

in the request. After the group is created, instances in the group are
created using the specified instance template.
This operation is marked as DONE when the group is created
even if the instances in the group have not yet been created. You must
separately verify the status of the individual instances with thelistmanagedinstances
method.

A regional managed instance group can contain up to 2000 instances.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the

| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `regionInstanceGroupManagers.listPerInstanceConfigs()`

Lists all of the per-instance configurations defined for the managed
instance group. The orderBy query parameter is not supported.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.instanceGroupManager` | `string` | Yes | The name of the managed instance group. It should conform to RFC1035. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request, should conform to RFC1035. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |

#### `regionInstanceGroupManagers.listErrors()`

Lists all errors thrown by actions on instances for a given regional
managed instance group. The filter andorderBy query parameters are not supported.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |

| `params.instanceGroupManager` | `string` | Yes | The name of the managed instance group.
It must be a string that meets the requirements in RFC1035, or an
unsigned long integer: must match regexp pattern:
(?:[a-z](?:[-a-z0-9]{0,61}[a-z0-9])?)|1-9{0,19}. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results

`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |

#### `regionInstanceGroupManagers.updatePerInstanceConfigs()`

Inserts or updates per-instance configurations for the managed instance
group. perInstanceConfig.name serves as a key used to
distinguish whether to perform insert or patch.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request, should conform to RFC1035. |

It should conform to RFC1035. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `regionInstanceGroupManagers.resize()`

Changes the intended size of the managed instance group. If you increase
the size, the group creates new instances using the current instance
template. If you decrease the size, the group deletes one or more
instances.

The resize operation is marked DONE if theresize request is successful. The underlying actions take
additional time. You must separately verify the status of thecreating or deleting actions with thelistmanagedinstances
method.

If the group is part of a backend
service that has enabled
connection draining, it can take up to 60 seconds after the connection
draining duration has elapsed before the VM instance is removed or deleted.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.size` | `integer` | Yes | Number of instances that should exist in this instance group
manager. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |

#### `regionInstanceGroupManagers.recreateInstances()`

Flags the specified VM instances in the managed instance group to be
immediately recreated. Each instance is recreated using the group's current
configuration. This operation is marked as DONE when the flag
is set even if the instances have not yet been recreated. You must
separately verify the status of each instance by checking itscurrentAction field; for more information, see Checking
the status of managed instances.

If the group is part of a backend
service that has enabled
connection draining, it can take up to 60 seconds after the connection
draining duration has elapsed before the VM instance is removed or deleted.

You can specify a maximum of 1000 instances with this method per request.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request. |

#### `regionInstanceGroupManagers.resizeAdvanced()`

Resizes the regional managed instance group with advanced configuration
options like disabling creation retries. This is an extended version of theresize method.

If you increase the size, the group creates new instances using the current
instance template. If you decrease the size, the group deletes one or more
instances.

The resize operation is marked DONE if theresize request is successful. The underlying actions take
additional time. You must separately verify the status of thecreating or deleting actions with the get
orlistmanagedinstances
method.

If the group is part of a backend
service that has enabled
connection draining, it can take up to 60 seconds after the connection
draining duration has elapsed before the VM instance is removed or deleted.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request.
It must be a string that meets the requirements in RFC1035. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |

#### `regionInstanceGroupManagers.list()`

Retrieves the list of managed instance groups that are contained
within the specified region.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |

#### `regionInstanceGroupManagers.testIamPermissions()`

Returns permissions that a caller has on the specified resource.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.resource` | `string` | Yes | Name or id of the resource for this request. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | The name of the region for this request. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `regionInstanceGroupManagers.startInstances()`

Flags the specified instances in the managed instance group to be
started. This method increases thetargetSize and decreases the targetStoppedSize
of the managed instance group by the number of instances that you start.
The startInstances operation is marked DONE if
the startInstances request is successful. The underlying
actions take additional time. You must separately verify the status of theSTARTING action with thelistmanagedinstances
method.

In this request, you can only specify instances that are stopped. For
example, if an instance was previously stopped using the stopInstances
method, it can be started using the startInstances method.

If a health check is attached to the managed instance group, the specified
instances will be verified as healthy after they are started.

You can specify a maximum of 1000 instances with this method per request.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.instanceGroupManager` | `string` | Yes | Name of the managed instance group. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `regionInstanceGroupManagers.stopInstances()`

Flags the specified instances in the managed instance group to be
immediately stopped. You can only specify instances that are running in
this request. This method reduces thetargetSize and increases the targetStoppedSize
of the managed instance group by the number of instances that you stop.
The stopInstances operation is marked DONE if
the stopInstances request is successful. The underlying
actions take additional time. You must separately verify the status of theSTOPPING action with thelistmanagedinstances
method.

If the standbyPolicy.initialDelaySec field is set, the group
delays stopping the instances until initialDelaySec have
passed from instance.creationTimestamp (that is, when the
instance was created). This delay gives your application time to
set itself up and initialize on the instance. If more thaninitialDelaySec seconds have passed sinceinstance.creationTimestamp when this method is called, there
will be zero delay.

If the group is part of a backend
service that has enabled
connection draining, it can take up to 60 seconds after the connection
draining duration has elapsed before the VM instance is stopped.

Stopped instances can be started using the startInstances
method.

You can specify a maximum of 1000 instances with this method per request.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `regionInstanceGroupManagers.setAutoHealingPolicies()`

in the request.
This operation is marked as DONE when the group is patched
even if the instances in the group are still in the process of being
patched. You must separately verify the status of the individual instances
with the listmanagedinstances
method. This method supportsPATCH
semantics and uses theJSON merge
patch format and processing rules.

If you update your group to specify a new template or instance
configuration, it's possible that your intended specification for each VM
in the group is different from the current state of that VM. To learn how
to apply an updated configuration to the VMs in a MIG, seeUpdating instances in
a MIG.

`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |

#### `instantSnapshots.setIamPolicy()`

Sets the access control policy on the specified resource.
Replaces any existing policy.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of the zone for this request. |
| `params.resource` | `string` | Yes | Name or id of the resource for this request. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `instantSnapshots.aggregatedList()`

Retrieves an aggregated list of instantSnapshots.

To prevent failure, Google recommends that you set the
`returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | Name of the zone for this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |

### `firewalls`

#### `firewalls.patch()`

Updates the specified firewall rule with the data included in the
request. This method supportsPATCH
semantics and uses theJSON merge
patch format and processing rules.

|---|---|---|---|
| `params.firewall` | `string` | Yes | Name of the firewall rule to patch. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |

are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:

are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |

| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
end_interface: MixerMutationRequestBuilder |
| `params.interconnectAttachmentGroup` | `string` | Yes | Name of the InterconnectAttachmentGroup resource to delete. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |

#### `interconnectAttachmentGroups.testIamPermissions()`

Returns permissions that a caller has on the specified resource.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.resource` | `string` | Yes | Name or id of the resource for this request. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

### `globalVmExtensionPolicies`

#### `globalVmExtensionPolicies.get()`

Gets details of a global VM extension policy.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.globalVmExtensionPolicy` | `string` | Yes | Name of the GlobalVmExtensionPolicy resource to return. |

#### `globalVmExtensionPolicies.aggregatedList()`

Retrieves the list of all VM Extension Policy resources
available to the specified project.

To prevent failure, it's recommended that you set the
`returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Name of the project scoping this request. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which
aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |

#### `globalVmExtensionPolicies.insert()`

#### `globalVmExtensionPolicies.delete()`

Purge scoped resources (zonal policies) from a global VM extension
policy, and then delete the global VM extension policy. Purge of the scoped
resources is a pre-condition of the global VM extension policy deletion.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `projects.setUsageExportBucket()`

Enables the usage export feature and sets theusage export bucket
where reports are stored. If you provide an empty request body using this
method, the usage export feature will be disabled.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |

#### `projects.get()`

Returns the specified Project resource.

To decrease latency for this method, you can optionally omit any unneeded
information from the response by using a field mask. This practice is
especially recommended for unused quota information (the `quotas` field).
To exclude one or more fields, set your request's `fields` query parameter
to only include the fields you need. For example, to only include the `id`
and `selfLink` fields, add the query parameter `?fields=id,selfLink` to
your request.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |

#### `projects.setCloudArmorTier()`

Sets the Cloud Armor tier of the project. To set ENTERPRISE or above the
billing account of the project must be subscribed to Cloud Armor
Enterprise. See Subscribing
to Cloud Armor Enterprise for more information.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |

#### `projects.moveInstance()`

Moves an instance and its attached persistent disks from one zone to
another.
*Note*: Moving VMs or disks by using this method might
 cause unexpected behavior. For more information, see the [known
 issue](/compute/docs/troubleshooting/known-issues#moving_vms_or_disks_using_the_moveinstance_api_or_the_causes_unexpected_behavior).
[Deprecated] This method is deprecated. See [moving instance across
zones](/compute/docs/instances/moving-instance-across-zones) instead.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

#### `projects.listXpnHosts()`

Lists all shared VPC host projects visible to the user in an organization.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |

### `zoneOperations`

#### `zoneOperations.wait()`

Waits for the specified Operation resource to return as `DONE`
or for the request to approach the 2 minute deadline, and retrieves the
specified Operation resource. This method waits for no more than the
2 minutes and then returns the current state of the
operation, which might be `DONE` or still in progress.

This method is called on a best-effort basis. Specifically:
   
   
    - In uncommon cases, when the server is overloaded, the request might
    return before the default deadline is reached, or might return after zero
    seconds.
   - If the default deadline is reached, there is no guarantee that the
    operation is actually done when the method returns. Be prepared to retry
    if the operation is not `DONE`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.operation` | `string` | Yes | Name of the Operations resource to return, or its unique numeric
identifier. |

| `params.operation` | `string` | Yes | Name of the Operations resource to delete, or its unique numeric
identifier. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |

### `sslCertificates`

#### `sslCertificates.list()`

Retrieves the list of SslCertificate resources available to the specified
project.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |

| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |

#### `sslCertificates.aggregatedList()`

Retrieves the list of all SslCertificate resources, regional and global,

of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Name of the project scoping this request. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which
aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |

| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

#### `regionHealthCheckServices.list()`

Lists all the HealthCheckService resources that have been
configured for the specified project in the given region.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |

#### `regionHealthCheckServices.patch()`

| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |

single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.

the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |

#### `networkFirewallPolicies.patchAssociation()`

Updates an association for the specified network firewall policy.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |

#### `networkFirewallPolicies.aggregatedList()`

Retrieves an aggregated list of network firewall policies, listing network
firewall policies from all applicable scopes (global and regional) and
grouping the results per scope.

To prevent failure, it is recommended that you set the
`returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which
aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |

#### `networkFirewallPolicies.removePacketMirroringRule()`

Deletes a packet mirroring rule of the specified priority.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.priority` | `integer` | No | The priority of the rule to remove from the firewall policy. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.firewallPolicy` | `string` | Yes | Name of the firewall policy to update. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |

#### `networkFirewallPolicies.cloneRules()`

Copies rules to the specified firewall policy.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.sourceFirewallPolicy` | `string` | No | The firewall policy from which to copy rules. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

project.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
