## API Reference

### `targetPools`

#### `targetPools.testIamPermissions()`

Returns permissions that a caller has on the specified resource.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | The name of the region for this request. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.resource` | `string` | Yes | Name or id of the resource for this request. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `targetPools.getHealth()`

Gets the most recent health check results for each IP for the
instance that is referenced by the given target pool.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.targetPool` | `string` | Yes | Name of the TargetPool resource to which the queried instance belongs. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `targetPools.aggregatedList()`

Retrieves an aggregated list of target pools.

To prevent failure, Google recommends that you set the
`returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which
aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |

#### `targetPools.get()`

Returns the specified target pool.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.targetPool` | `string` | Yes | Name of the TargetPool resource to return. |

#### `targetPools.list()`

Retrieves a list of target pools available to the specified
project and region.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:

the data included in the request.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |

### `nodeTypes`

#### `nodeTypes.aggregatedList()`

Retrieves an aggregated list of node types.

To prevent failure, Google recommends that you set the
`returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which
aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |

#### `nodeTypes.get()`

Returns the specified node type.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |

request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.instanceGroupManager` | `string` | Yes | The name of the managed instance group.
Name should conform to RFC1035 or be a resource ID. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |

#### `regionInstanceGroupManagerResizeRequests.list()`

Retrieves a list of Resize Requests that are contained in the
managed instance group.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region
scoping this request. Name should conform to RFC1035. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.instanceGroupManager` | `string` | Yes | The name of the managed instance group. The name should conform to RFC1035. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |

| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

| `params.interconnectAttachmentGroup` | `string` | Yes | Name of the InterconnectAttachmentGroup resource to patch. |
| `params.updateMask` | `string` | No | The list of fields to update. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

end_interface: MixerMutationRequestBuilder |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |

#### `interconnectAttachmentGroups.list()`

Lists the InterconnectAttachmentGroups for a project in the given scope.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |

| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This

the next page of results. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.nodeGroup` | `string` | Yes | Name of the NodeGroup resource whose nodes you want to list. |

single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |

`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |

#### `nodeGroups.aggregatedList()`

Retrieves an aggregated list of node groups.
Note: use nodeGroups.listNodes for more details about each group.

To prevent failure, Google recommends that you set the
`returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which
aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |

request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results

| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |

#### `regionHealthSources.aggregatedList()`

regional) available to the specified project.

To prevent failure, Google recommends that you set the
`returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added

`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which
aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |

#### `instantSnapshots.get()`

Returns the specified InstantSnapshot resource in the specified zone.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of the zone for this request. |
| `params.instantSnapshot` | `string` | Yes | Name of the InstantSnapshot resource to return. |

#### `instantSnapshots.testIamPermissions()`

Returns permissions that a caller has on the specified resource.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.resource` | `string` | Yes | Name or id of the resource for this request. |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of the zone for this request. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `instantSnapshots.delete()`

Deletes the specified InstantSnapshot resource. Keep in mind that deleting
a single instantSnapshot might not necessarily delete all the data on that
instantSnapshot. If any data on the instantSnapshot that is marked for
deletion is needed for subsequent instantSnapshots, the data will be moved
to the next corresponding instantSnapshot.

For more information, seeDeleting
instantSnapshots.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of the zone for this request. |

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of the zone for this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:

The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR

```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Name of the project scoping this request. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which
aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |

(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |

### `machineTypes`

#### `machineTypes.list()`

Retrieves a list of machine types available to the specified
project.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of the zone for this request. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular

| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.machineType` | `string` | Yes | Name of the machine type to return. |

#### `machineTypes.aggregatedList()`

Retrieves an aggregated list of machine types.

To prevent failure, Google recommends that you set the
`returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |

| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which
aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |

### `globalVmExtensionPolicies`

#### `globalVmExtensionPolicies.delete()`

Purge scoped resources (zonal policies) from a global VM extension
policy, and then delete the global VM extension policy. Purge of the scoped
resources is a pre-condition of the global VM extension policy deletion.
The deletion of the global VM extension policy happens after the purge
rollout is done, so it's not a part of the LRO. It's an automatic process
that triggers in the backend.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.globalVmExtensionPolicy` | `string` | Yes | Name of the global VM extension policy to purge scoped resources for. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `globalVmExtensionPolicies.aggregatedList()`

Retrieves the list of all VM Extension Policy resources
available to the specified project.

To prevent failure, it's recommended that you set the
`returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |

#### `regionOperations.delete()`

Deletes the specified region-specific Operations resource.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region for this request. |
| `params.operation` | `string` | Yes | Name of the Operations resource to delete, or its unique numeric
identifier. |

#### `regionOperations.get()`

Retrieves the specified region-specific Operations resource.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.operation` | `string` | Yes | Name of the Operations resource to return, or its unique numeric
identifier. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region for this request. |

#### `regionOperations.wait()`

Waits for the specified Operation resource to return as `DONE`
or for the request to approach the 2 minute deadline, and retrieves the
specified Operation resource. This method differs from the
`GET` method in that it waits for no more than the default
deadline (2 minutes) and then returns the current state of the operation,
which might be `DONE` or still in progress.

This method is called on a best-effort basis. Specifically:
   
   
    - In uncommon cases, when the server is overloaded, the request might
    return before the default deadline is reached, or might return after zero
    seconds.
   - If the default deadline is reached, there is no guarantee that the
    operation is actually done when the method returns. Be prepared to retry
    if the operation is not `DONE`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.operation` | `string` | Yes | Name of the Operations resource to return, or its unique numeric
identifier. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region for this request. |

(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |

#### `regionMultiMigMembers.get()`

Retrieves information about the specified multi-MIG member.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.multiMig` | `string` | Yes | The name of the multi-MIG.
Name should conform to RFC1035 or be a resource ID. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region for this request. Region name should conform to RFC1035. |

| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |

#### `targetGrpcProxies.list()`

Lists the TargetGrpcProxies for a project in the given scope.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case

| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`

`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.parentId` | `string` | No | Parent ID for this request. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |

#### `organizationSecurityPolicies.addAssociation()`

Inserts an association for the specified security policy.

This has billing implications.  Projects in the hierarchy with effective
hierarchical security policies will be automatically enrolled into Cloud
Armor Enterprise if not already enrolled.

Use this API to modify Cloud Armor policies. Previously, alpha and beta
versions of this API were used to modify firewall policies. This usage is
now disabled for most organizations. Use firewallPolicies.addAssociation
instead.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.securityPolicy` | `string` | Yes | Name of the security policy to update. |

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |

#### `organizationSecurityPolicies.listPreconfiguredExpressionSets()`

Gets the current list of preconfigured Web Application Firewall (WAF)
expressions.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case

with an error code. |
| `params.parentId` | `string` | No | Parent ID for this request. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |

#### `organizationSecurityPolicies.insert()`

Creates a new policy in the specified organization using the data included
in the request.

Use this API to add Cloud Armor policies. Previously, alpha and beta
versions of this API were used to add firewall policies. This usage is now
disabled for most organizations. Use firewallPolicies.insert instead.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.parentId` | `string` | No | Parent ID for this request. The ID can be either be "folders/[FOLDER_ID]"
if the parent is a folder or "organizations/[ORGANIZATION_ID]" if the
parent is an organization. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same

| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.serviceProject` | `string` | No | The project id or project number in which the subnetwork is intended to be
used. Only applied for Shared VPC. See [Shared VPC
documentation](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/shared-vpc/) |

| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added

types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |

If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |

#### `targetInstances.delete()`

Deletes the specified TargetInstance resource.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | Name of the zone scoping this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |

| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |

#### `routes.list()`

Retrieves the list of Route resources available to the specified project.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |

### `instanceSettings`

#### `instanceSettings.patch()`

| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The zone scoping this request. It should conform to RFC1035. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This

timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.networkEndpointGroup` | `string` | Yes | The name of the network endpoint group from which you want to generate a
list of included network endpoints. It should comply with RFC1035. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |

#### `globalNetworkEndpointGroups.delete()`

Deletes the specified network endpoint group.Note that the NEG cannot be
deleted if there are backend services referencing it.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |

#### `regionTargetHttpsProxies.list()`

Retrieves the list of TargetHttpsProxy resources available
to the specified project in the specified region.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |

#### `regionTargetHttpsProxies.setSslCertificates()`

Replaces SslCertificates for TargetHttpsProxy.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request. |

### `interconnectRemoteLocations`

#### `interconnectRemoteLocations.get()`

Returns the details for the specified interconnect remote location. Gets a
list of available interconnect remote locations by making alist() request.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.interconnectRemoteLocation` | `string` | Yes | Name of the interconnect remote location to return. |

#### `interconnectRemoteLocations.list()`

Retrieves the list of interconnect remote locations available to the
specified project.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |

### `storagePools`

#### `storagePools.aggregatedList()`

Retrieves an aggregated list of storage pools.

To prevent failure, Google recommends that you set the
`returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which
aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most

These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.

|---|---|---|---|
| `params.rolloutPlan` | `string` | Yes | Name of the RolloutPlan resource to delete. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

images.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.license` | `string` | Yes | Name of the License resource to return. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |

#### `licenses.list()`

Retrieves the list of licenses
available in the specified project. This method does not
get any licenses that belong to other projects, including licenses attached
to publicly-available images, like Debian 9. If you want to get a list of
publicly-available licenses, use this method to make a request to the
respective image project, such as debian-cloud orwindows-cloud.
 *Caution* This resource is intended
for use only by third-party partners who are creatingCloud Marketplace
images.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |

images.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.updateMask` | `string` | No | update_mask indicates fields to be updated as part of this request. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.license` | `string` | Yes | The license name for this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the

the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request. |

#### `regionAutoscalers.list()`

Retrieves a list of autoscalers contained within
the specified region.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |

#### `regionAutoscalers.update()`

Updates an autoscaler in the specified project using
the data included in the request.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.autoscaler` | `string` | No | Name of the autoscaler to update. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |

| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which
aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results

request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region for this request. |

| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region for this request. |

#### `regionCommitments.cancel()`

Cancel the specified commitment.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region for this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the

#### `regionCommitments.list()`

Retrieves a list of commitments contained within
the specified region.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region for this request. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |

#### `regionCommitments.aggregatedList()`

Retrieves an aggregated list of commitments by region.

To prevent failure, it is recommended that you set the
`returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

#### `instances.updateShieldedVmConfig()`

Updates the Shielded VM config for a VM instance. You can
only use this method on a stopped VM instance. This method supportsPATCH
semantics and uses theJSON merge
patch format and processing rules.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of the zone for this request. |
| `params.instance` | `string` | Yes | Name of the instance scoping this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |

| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of the zone for this request. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `instances.list()`

Retrieves the list of instances contained within
the specified zone.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of the zone for this request. |
| `params.view` | `string` | No | View of the instance. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |

#### `instances.updateDisplayDevice()`

request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |

refers to discarded output, the start position is adjusted to the oldest
output still available, and the adjusted start position is returned as the
`start` property value.

You can also provide a negative start position, which translates to the
most recent number of bytes written to the serial port. For example, -3 is
interpreted as the most recent 3 bytes written to the serial console. Note
that the negative start is bounded by the retained buffer size, and the

#### `instances.aggregatedList()`

Retrieves an aggregated list of all of the instances in your project

The performance of this method degrades when a filter is specified on a
project that has a very large number of instances.

To prevent failure, Google recommends that you set the
`returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which
aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |

| `params.sourceMachineImage` | `string` | No | Specifies the machine image to use to create the instance.

This field is optional. It can be a full or partial URL. For example, the
following are all valid URLs to a machine image:
   
   
      - https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/project/global/global/machineImages/machineImage
      - projects/project/global/global/machineImages/machineImage
      - global/machineImages/machineImage |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.sourceInstanceTemplate` | `string` | No | Specifies instance template to create the instance.

This field is optional. It can be a full or partial URL. For example, the
following are all valid URLs to an instance template:
   
   
      - https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/project/global/instanceTemplates/instanceTemplate
      - projects/project/global/instanceTemplates/instanceTemplate
      - global/instanceTemplates/instanceTemplate |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of the zone for this request. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `instances.setMetadata()`

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of the zone for this request. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.instance` | `string` | Yes | Name of the instance scoping this request. |

#### `instances.listReferrers()`

Retrieves a list of resources that refer to the VM instance specified in
the request. For example, if the VM instance is part of a managed or
unmanaged instance group, the referrers list includes the instance group.
For more information, readViewing
referrers to VM instances.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.instance` | `string` | Yes | Name of the target instance scoping this request, or '-' if the
request should span over all instances in the container. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of the zone for this request. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |

#### `instances.setShieldedVmIntegrityPolicy()`

only use this method on a running VM instance. This method
supports PATCH semantics and uses the JSON merge
patch format and processing rules.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.instance` | `string` | Yes | Name of the instance scoping this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of the zone for this request. |

| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Name of the project scoping this request. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |

#### `regionDisks.delete()`

Deletes the specified regional persistent disk. Deleting a regional disk
removes all the replicas of its data permanently and is irreversible.

#### `regionDisks.list()`

Retrieves the list of persistent disks contained within
the specified region.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region for this request. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | Name of the zone for this request. |

#### `autoscalers.aggregatedList()`

Retrieves an aggregated list of autoscalers.

To prevent failure, it is recommended that you set the
`returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which
aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |

| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in

#### `routers.update()`

Updates the specified Router resource with the data included in the
request.  This method conforms toPUT semantics, which requests that the state of the
target resource be created or replaced with the state defined by the
representation enclosed in the request message payload.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |

that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |

`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |

#### `routers.getNatIpInfo()`

| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case

| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `urlMaps.delete()`

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.urlMap` | `string` | Yes | Name of the UrlMap resource to delete. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so

#### `urlMaps.aggregatedList()`

Retrieves the list of all UrlMap resources, regional and global,
available to the specified project.

To prevent failure, Google recommends that you set the
`returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Name of the project scoping this request. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which
aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |

#### `urlMaps.testIamPermissions()`

Returns permissions that a caller has on the specified resource.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.resource` | `string` | Yes | Name or id of the resource for this request. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `urlMaps.patch()`

Patches the specified UrlMap resource with the data included in the
request. This method supportsPATCH
semantics and uses theJSON merge
patch format and processing rules.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.urlMap` | `string` | Yes | Name of the UrlMap resource to patch. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

### `acceleratorTypes`

#### `acceleratorTypes.list()`

Retrieves a list of accelerator types that are available to the specified
project.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results

#### `regionNetworkPolicies.aggregatedList()`

Retrieves an aggregated list of network policies.

To prevent failure, it's recommended that you set the
`returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which
aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported

must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.region` | `string` | No | The region of the request. The response will include all subnet routes,
static routes and dynamic routes in the region. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.network` | `string` | Yes | Name of the network for this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.peeringName` | `string` | No | The response will show routes exchanged over the given peering connection. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |

| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |

| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |

you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an

(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |

#### `snapshotGroups.delete()`

Deletes the specified SnapshotGroup resource

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.snapshotGroup` | `string` | Yes | Name of the SnapshotGroup resource to delete. |

| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and

(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region for this request. |

#### `vpnTunnels.aggregatedList()`

Retrieves an aggregated list of VPN tunnels.

To prevent failure, Google recommends that you set the
`returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which
aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |

#### `vpnTunnels.setLabels()`

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |

#### `storagePoolTypes.list()`

Retrieves a list of storage pool types available to the specified
project.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

#### `zoneOperations.wait()`

Waits for the specified Operation resource to return as `DONE`
or for the request to approach the 2 minute deadline, and retrieves the
specified Operation resource. This method waits for no more than the
2 minutes and then returns the current state of the
operation, which might be `DONE` or still in progress.

This method is called on a best-effort basis. Specifically:
   
   
    - In uncommon cases, when the server is overloaded, the request might
    return before the default deadline is reached, or might return after zero
    seconds.
   - If the default deadline is reached, there is no guarantee that the
    operation is actually done when the method returns. Be prepared to retry
    if the operation is not `DONE`.

`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | Name of the zone for request. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering

```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |

### `globalFolderOperations`

#### `globalFolderOperations.get()`

#### `firewallPolicies.list()`

Lists all the policies that have been configured for the specified
folder or organization.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.parentId` | `string` | No | Parent ID for this request. The ID can be either be "folders/[FOLDER_ID]"
if the parent is a folder or "organizations/[ORGANIZATION_ID]" if the
parent is an organization. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |

#### `packetMirrorings.list()`

Retrieves a list of PacketMirroring resources available to the specified
project and region.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region for this request. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |

#### `packetMirrorings.aggregatedList()`

Retrieves an aggregated list of packetMirrorings.

To prevent failure, Google recommends that you set the
`returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |

`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |

#### `packetMirrorings.delete()`

#### `regionHealthChecks.testIamPermissions()`

Returns permissions that a caller has on the specified resource.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.resource` | `string` | Yes | Name or id of the resource for this request. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | The name of the region for this request. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `regionHealthChecks.list()`

Retrieves the list of HealthCheck resources available to the specified
project.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |

#### `regionHealthChecks.update()`

Updates a HealthCheck resource in the specified project using the data
included in the request.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |

aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Name of the project scoping this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case

you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |

request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of the zone where
the network endpoint group is located. It should comply with RFC1035. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `networkEndpointGroups.detachNetworkEndpoints()`

Detach a list of network endpoints from the specified network endpoint
group.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.networkEndpointGroup` | `string` | Yes | The name of the network endpoint group where you are removing network
endpoints. It should comply with RFC1035. |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of the zone where
the network endpoint group is located. It should comply with RFC1035. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `networkEndpointGroups.aggregatedList()`

Retrieves the list of network endpoint groups and sorts them by zone.

To prevent failure, Google recommends that you set the
`returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which
aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |

#### `networkEndpointGroups.get()`

Returns the specified network endpoint group.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.networkEndpointGroup` | `string` | Yes | The name of the network endpoint group. It should comply with RFC1035. |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of the zone where
the network endpoint group is located. It should comply with RFC1035. |

#### `networkEndpointGroups.delete()`

Deletes the specified network endpoint group. The network endpoints in the
NEG and the VM instances they belong to are not terminated when the NEG is
deleted. Note that the NEG cannot be deleted if there are backend services
referencing it.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of the zone where
the network endpoint group is located. It should comply with RFC1035. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.networkEndpointGroup` | `string` | Yes | The name of the network endpoint group to delete. It should comply with
RFC1035. |

Retrieves an aggregated list of resource policies.

To prevent failure, Google recommends that you set the
`returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which
aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |

| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |

#### `interconnects.list()`

Retrieves the list of Interconnects available to the specified project.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |

### `regionNotificationEndpoints`

#### `regionNotificationEndpoints.delete()`

Deletes the specified NotificationEndpoint in the given region

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request. |
| `params.notificationEndpoint` | `string` | Yes | Name of the NotificationEndpoint resource to delete. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |

#### `regionNotificationEndpoints.get()`

Returns the specified NotificationEndpoint resource in the given region.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|

| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `regionNotificationEndpoints.list()`

Lists the NotificationEndpoints for a project in the given region.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the

| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always

(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `firewalls.list()`

Retrieves the list of firewall rules available to the specified
project.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |

`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which
aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results

if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular

| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |

#### `instanceGroupManagers.abandonInstances()`

Flags the specified instances to be removed from the
managed instance group. Abandoning an instance does not delete the
instance, but it does remove the instance from any target pools that are
applied by the managed instance group. This method reduces thetargetSize of the managed instance group by the
number of instances that you abandon. This operation is marked asDONE when the action is scheduled even if the instances have
not yet been removed from the group. You must separately verify the
status of the abandoning action with thelistmanagedinstances
method.

If the group is part of a backend
service that has enabled
connection draining, it can take up to 60 seconds after the connection
draining duration has elapsed before the VM instance is removed or deleted.

You can specify a maximum of 1000 instances with this method per request.

| `params.instanceGroupManager` | `string` | Yes | The name of the managed instance group. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `instanceGroupManagers.get()`

Returns all of the details about the specified managed instance group.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.instanceGroupManager` | `string` | Yes | The name of the managed instance group. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of thezone where the managed

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

deletion. The instances are also removed from any target
pools of which they were a member. This method reduces thetargetSize of the managed instance group by the number of
instances that you delete. This operation is marked as DONE
when the action is scheduled even if the instances are still being deleted.
You must separately verify the status of the deleting action
with thelistmanagedinstances
method.

If the group is part of a backend
service that has enabled
connection draining, it can take up to 60 seconds after the connection

#### `instanceGroupManagers.resizeAdvanced()`

Resizes the managed instance group with advanced configuration options like
disabling creation retries. This is an extended version of theresize method.

If you increase the size of the instance group, the group creates new
instances using the current instance template. If you decrease the size,
the group deletes instances. The resize operation is markedDONE when the resize actions are scheduled even if the group
has not yet added or deleted any instances. You must separately
verify the status of the creating,creatingWithoutRetries, or deleting actions with
the get
orlistmanagedinstances
method.

If the group is part of a backend
service that has enabled
connection draining, it can take up to 60 seconds after the connection

#### `instanceGroupManagers.resumeInstances()`

Flags the specified instances in the managed instance group to be
resumed. This method increases thetargetSize and decreases the targetSuspendedSize
of the managed instance group by the number of instances that you resume.
The resumeInstances operation is marked DONE if
the resumeInstances request is successful. The underlying
actions take additional time. You must separately verify the status of theRESUMING action with thelistmanagedinstances
method.

In this request, you can only specify instances that are suspended. For
example, if an instance was previously suspended using the suspendInstances
method, it can be resumed using the resumeInstances method.

If a health check is attached to the managed instance group, the specified
instances will be verified as healthy after they are resumed.

You can specify a maximum of 1000 instances with this method per request.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of thezone where the managed
instance group is located. |
| `params.instanceGroupManager` | `string` | Yes | The name of the managed instance group. |

| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `instanceGroupManagers.listManagedInstances()`

Lists all of the instances in the managed instance group. Each instance
in the list has a currentAction, which indicates the action
that the managed instance group is performing on the instance. For example,
if the group is still creating an instance, the currentAction
is CREATING. If a previous action failed, the
list displays the errors for that failed action. The orderBy
query parameter is not supported. The `pageToken` query parameter is
supported only if the group's `listManagedInstancesResults` field is set
to `PAGINATED`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.instanceGroupManager` | `string` | Yes | The name of the managed instance group. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of thezone where the managed
instance group is located. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |

#### `instanceGroupManagers.createInstances()`

Creates instances with per-instance configurations in this managed instance
group. Instances are created using the current instance template. Thecreate instances operation is marked DONE if thecreateInstances request is successful. The underlying actions
take additional time. You must separately verify the status of thecreating or actions with the listmanagedinstances
method.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.instanceGroupManager` | `string` | Yes | The name of the managed instance group.
It should conform to RFC1035. |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of thezone
where the managed instance group is located.
It should conform to RFC1035. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `instanceGroupManagers.listPerInstanceConfigs()`

#### `instanceGroupManagers.resize()`

Resizes the managed instance group. If you increase the size, the group
creates new instances using the current instance template. If you decrease
the size, the group deletes instances. The resize operation is markedDONE when the resize actions are scheduled even if the group
has not yet added or deleted any instances. You must separately
verify the status of the creating or deleting
actions with thelistmanagedinstances
method.

When resizing down, the instance group arbitrarily chooses the order in
which VMs are deleted. The group takes into account some VM attributes when
making the selection including:

+ The status of the VM instance.
+ The health of the VM instance.
+ The instance template version the VM is based on.
+ For regional managed instance groups, the location of the VM instance.

This list is subject to change.

If the group is part of a backend
service that has enabled
connection draining, it can take up to 60 seconds after the connection
draining duration has elapsed before the VM instance is removed or deleted.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.instanceGroupManager` | `string` | Yes | The name of the managed instance group. |
| `params.size` | `integer` | Yes | The number of running instances that the managed instance group should
maintain at any given time. The group automatically adds or removes
instances to maintain the number of instances specified by this parameter. |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of thezone where the managed
instance group is located. |

#### `instanceGroupManagers.listErrors()`

#### `instanceGroupManagers.updatePerInstanceConfigs()`

Inserts or updates per-instance configurations for the managed instance
group. perInstanceConfig.name serves as a key used to
distinguish whether to perform insert or patch.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.instanceGroupManager` | `string` | Yes | The name of the managed instance group.
It should conform to RFC1035. |

| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `instanceGroupManagers.startInstances()`

Flags the specified instances in the managed instance group to be
started. This method increases thetargetSize and decreases the targetStoppedSize
of the managed instance group by the number of instances that you start.
The startInstances operation is marked DONE if
the startInstances request is successful. The underlying
actions take additional time. You must separately verify the status of theSTARTING action with thelistmanagedinstances
method.

In this request, you can only specify instances that are stopped. For
example, if an instance was previously stopped using the stopInstances
method, it can be started using the startInstances method.

If a health check is attached to the managed instance group, the specified
instances will be verified as healthy after they are started.

You can specify a maximum of 1000 instances with this method per request.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of thezone where the managed
instance group is located. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.instanceGroupManager` | `string` | Yes | The name of the managed instance group. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `instanceGroupManagers.patch()`

Updates a managed instance group using the information that you specify
in the request.
This operation is marked as DONE when the group is patched
even if the instances in the group are still in the process of being
patched. You must separately verify the status of the individual instances
with thelistManagedInstances
method. This method supportsPATCH
semantics and uses theJSON merge
patch format and processing rules.

If you update your group to specify a new template or instance
configuration, it's possible that your intended specification for each VM
in the group is different from the current state of that VM. To learn how
to apply an updated configuration to the VMs in a MIG, seeUpdating instances in
a MIG.

|---|---|---|---|
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.instanceGroupManager` | `string` | Yes | The name of the instance group manager. |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of the zone where
you want to create the managed instance group. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `instanceGroupManagers.suspendInstances()`

Flags the specified instances in the managed instance group to be
immediately suspended. You can only specify instances that are running in
this request. This method reduces thetargetSize and increases the targetSuspendedSize
of the managed instance group by the number of instances that you suspend.
The suspendInstances operation is marked DONE if
the suspendInstances request is successful. The underlying
actions take additional time. You must separately verify the status of theSUSPENDING action with thelistmanagedinstances
method.

If the standbyPolicy.initialDelaySec field is set, the group
delays suspension of the instances until initialDelaySec have
passed from instance.creationTimestamp (that is, when the
instance was created). This delay gives your application time to
set itself up and initialize on the instance. If more thaninitialDelaySec seconds have passed sinceinstance.creationTimestamp when this method is called, there
will be zero delay.

If the group is part of a backend
service that has enabled
connection draining, it can take up to 60 seconds after the connection
draining duration has elapsed before the VM instance is suspended.

Suspended instances can be resumed using the resumeInstances
method.

You can specify a maximum of 1000 instances with this method per request.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

instance group is located. |
| `params.instanceGroupManager` | `string` | Yes | The name of the managed instance group. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `instanceGroupManagers.recreateInstances()`

Flags the specified VM instances in the managed instance group to be
immediately recreated. Each instance is recreated using the group's current
configuration. This operation is marked as DONE when the flag
is set even if the instances have not yet been recreated. You must
separately verify the status of each instance by checking itscurrentAction field; for more information, see Checking
the status of managed instances.

If the group is part of a backend
service that has enabled
connection draining, it can take up to 60 seconds after the connection
draining duration has elapsed before the VM instance is removed or deleted.

You can specify a maximum of 1000 instances with this method per request.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.instanceGroupManager` | `string` | Yes | The name of the managed instance group. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of thezone where the managed
instance group is located. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `instanceGroupManagers.insert()`

Creates a managed instance group using the information that you specify
in the request. After the group is created, instances in the group are
created using the specified instance template.
This operation is marked as DONE when the group is created
even if the instances in the group have not yet been created. You
must separately verify the status of the individual instances with thelistmanagedinstances
method.

A managed instance group can have up to 1000 VM instances per group. Please
contact Cloud Support if you need an increase in
this limit.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of the zone
where you want to create the managed instance group. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `instanceGroupManagers.list()`

Retrieves a list of managed instance groups that are contained within the
specified project and zone.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of thezone where the managed
instance group is located. |

#### `instanceGroupManagers.patchPerInstanceConfigs()`

Inserts or patches per-instance configurations for the managed instance
group. perInstanceConfig.name serves as a key used to
distinguish whether to perform insert or patch.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of thezone
where the managed instance group is located.
It should conform to RFC1035. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.instanceGroupManager` | `string` | Yes | The name of the managed instance group.
It should conform to RFC1035. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `instanceGroupManagers.setTargetPools()`

Modifies the target pools to which all instances in this managed instance
group are assigned. The target pools automatically apply to all of the
instances in the managed instance group. This operation is markedDONE when you make the request even if the instances have not
yet been added to their target pools. The change might take some time to
apply to all of the instances in the group depending on the size of the
group.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.instanceGroupManager` | `string` | Yes | The name of the managed instance group. |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of thezone where the managed
instance group is located. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `instanceGroupManagers.stopInstances()`

Flags the specified instances in the managed instance group to be
immediately stopped. You can only specify instances that are running in
this request. This method reduces thetargetSize and increases the targetStoppedSize
of the managed instance group by the number of instances that you stop.
The stopInstances operation is marked DONE if
the stopInstances request is successful. The underlying
actions take additional time. You must separately verify the status of theSTOPPING action with thelistmanagedinstances
method.

If the standbyPolicy.initialDelaySec field is set, the group
delays stopping the instances until initialDelaySec have
passed from instance.creationTimestamp (that is, when the
instance was created). This delay gives your application time to
set itself up and initialize on the instance. If more thaninitialDelaySec seconds have passed sinceinstance.creationTimestamp when this method is called, there
will be zero delay.

If the group is part of a backend
service that has enabled
connection draining, it can take up to 60 seconds after the connection
draining duration has elapsed before the VM instance is stopped.

Stopped instances can be started using the startInstances
method.

You can specify a maximum of 1000 instances with this method per request.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of thezone where the managed
instance group is located. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so

| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `instanceGroupManagers.update()`

Updates a managed instance group using the information that you specify
in the request.
This operation is marked as DONE when the group is updated
even if the instances in the group have not yet been updated. You must
separately verify the status of the individual instances with thelistManagedInstances
method.

If you update your group to specify a new template or instance
configuration, it's possible that your intended specification for each VM
in the group is different from the current state of that VM. To learn how
to apply an updated configuration to the VMs in a MIG, seeUpdating instances in
a MIG.

`returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which
aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |

### `crossSiteNetworks`

#### `crossSiteNetworks.patch()`

Updates the specified cross-site network with the data included in
the request. This method supportsPATCH
semantics and uses theJSON merge
patch format and processing rules.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
end_interface: MixerMutationRequestBuilder |

#### `crossSiteNetworks.insert()`

|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.validateOnly` | `boolean` | No | [Input Only] Validate the new configuration, but don't create it. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This

| `params.rollout` | `string` | Yes | Name of the Rollout resource to delete. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |

#### `rollouts.list()`

Lists Rollouts in a given project and location.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |

that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.rollback` | `boolean` | No | Optional. If true, then the ongoing rollout must be rolled back. Else, just cancel
the rollout without taking any further actions. Note that products must
support at least one of these options, however, it does not need to support
both. |
| `params.rollout` | `string` | Yes | Name of the Rollout resource to cancel. |

`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `disks.update()`

Updates the specified disk with the data included in the request.
The update is performed only on selected fields included as part
of update-mask. Only the following fields can be modified: user_license.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.updateMask` | `string` | No | update_mask indicates fields to be updated as part of this request. |
| `params.disk` | `string` | Yes | The disk name for this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |

Can be invoked either in the primary or secondary scope.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of the zone for this request. This must be the zone of the primary
or secondary disks in the consistency group. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `disks.aggregatedList()`

Retrieves an aggregated list of persistent disks.

To prevent failure, it is recommended that you set the
`returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which
aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |

request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `regionTargetHttpProxies.get()`

Returns the specified TargetHttpProxy resource in the specified region.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.targetHttpProxy` | `string` | Yes | Name of the TargetHttpProxy resource to return. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request. |

#### `regionTargetHttpProxies.list()`

Retrieves the list of TargetHttpProxy resources available
to the specified project in the specified region.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |

#### `regionTargetHttpProxies.delete()`

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request. |

|---|---|---|---|
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which
aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |

of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results

results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |

|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | Name of the zone for this request. |
| `params.vmExtensionPolicy` | `string` | Yes | Name of the zone VM extension policy to update. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `zoneVmExtensionPolicies.list()`

Lists all VM extension policies within a specific zone for a project.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | Name of the zone for this request. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |

request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This

must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which
aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |

#### `snapshots.insert()`

Creates a snapshot in the specified project using the data included
in the request. For regular snapshot creation, consider using this method
instead of disks.createSnapshot,
as this method supports more features, such as creating snapshots in a
project different from the source disk project.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

### `regionHealthAggregationPolicies`

| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same

(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `regionHealthAggregationPolicies.list()`

Lists the HealthAggregationPolicies for a project in the given region.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |

Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request.
It must be a string that meets the requirements in RFC1035. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |

#### `regionBackendServices.insert()`

the data included in the request. For more information, see
Backend services overview.

| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `regionBackendServices.list()`

specified project in the given region.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |

### `regions`

#### `regions.get()`

Returns the specified Region resource.

To decrease latency for this method, you can optionally omit any unneeded
information from the response by using a field mask. This practice is
especially recommended for unused quota information (the `quotas` field).
To exclude one or more fields, set your request's `fields` query parameter
to only include the fields you need. For example, to only include the `id`
and `selfLink` fields, add the query parameter `?fields=id,selfLink` to
your request.

This method fails if the quota information is unavailable for the region
and if the organization policy constraint
compute.requireBasicQuotaInResponse is enforced. This
constraint, when enforced, disables the fail-open behaviour when quota
information (the `items.quotas` field) is unavailable for the region.
It is recommended to use the default setting
for the constraint unless your application requires the fail-closed
behaviour for this method.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region resource to return. |

#### `regions.list()`

that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |

the specified project.

To prevent failure, Google recommends that you set the
`returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which
aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:

with an error code. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Name of the project scoping this request. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |

#### `networkEdgeSecurityServices.insert()`

the request.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which
aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |

#### `networkFirewallPolicies.testIamPermissions()`

Returns permissions that a caller has on the specified resource.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.resource` | `string` | Yes | Name or id of the resource for this request. |

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |

#### `networkFirewallPolicies.list()`

Lists all the policies that have been configured for the specified project.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |

Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |

#### `backendBuckets.aggregatedList()`

Retrieves the list of all BackendBucket resources, regional and global,
available to the specified project.

To prevent failure, it is recommended that you set the
`returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which
aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Name of the project scoping this request. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |

#### `backendBuckets.listUsable()`

request.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which
aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |

#### `instanceGroups.get()`

Returns the specified zonal instance group. Get a list of available zonal
instance groups by making a list() request.

For managed instance groups, use theinstanceGroupManagers
or regionInstanceGroupManagers
methods instead.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.instanceGroup` | `string` | Yes | The name of the instance group. |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of the zone
where the instance group is located. |

#### `instanceGroups.list()`

Retrieves the list of zonal instance group resources contained within the
specified zone.

For managed instance groups, use theinstanceGroupManagers
or regionInstanceGroupManagers
methods instead.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of thezone
where the instance group is located. |

#### `instanceGroups.setNamedPorts()`

Sets the named ports for the specified instance group.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.instanceGroup` | `string` | Yes | The name of the instance group where the named ports are updated. |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of the zone
where the instance group is located. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

### `backendServices`

`returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get

| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:

can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |

the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |

#### `backendServices.update()`

Updates the specified BackendService resource with the data included in the
request. For more information, seeBackend
services overview.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.backendService` | `string` | Yes | Name of the BackendService resource to update. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

### `diskTypes`

#### `diskTypes.list()`

Retrieves a list of disk types available to the specified
project.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of the zone for this request. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |

#### `diskTypes.get()`

Returns the specified disk type.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.diskType` | `string` | Yes | Name of the disk type to return. |

| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |

#### `diskTypes.aggregatedList()`

Retrieves an aggregated list of disk types.

To prevent failure, it is recommended that you set the
`returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most

#### `targetHttpsProxies.aggregatedList()`

Retrieves the list of all TargetHttpsProxy resources, regional and global,
available to the specified project.

To prevent failure, Google recommends that you set the
`returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which
aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Name of the project scoping this request. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.instanceGroupManager` | `string` | Yes | The name of the managed instance group.
It should conform to RFC1035. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be

|---|---|---|---|
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request, should conform to RFC1035. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results

| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |

#### `regionInstanceGroupManagers.resize()`

Changes the intended size of the managed instance group. If you increase
the size, the group creates new instances using the current instance
template. If you decrease the size, the group deletes one or more
instances.

The resize operation is marked DONE if theresize request is successful. The underlying actions take
additional time. You must separately verify the status of thecreating or deleting actions with thelistmanagedinstances
method.

If the group is part of a backend
service that has enabled
connection draining, it can take up to 60 seconds after the connection
draining duration has elapsed before the VM instance is removed or deleted.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the

| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |

#### `regionInstanceGroupManagers.insert()`

Creates a managed instance group using the information that you specify
in the request. After the group is created, instances in the group are
created using the specified instance template.
This operation is marked as DONE when the group is created
even if the instances in the group have not yet been created. You must
separately verify the status of the individual instances with thelistmanagedinstances
method.

A regional managed instance group can contain up to 2000 instances.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request. |

| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `regionInstanceGroupManagers.resizeAdvanced()`

Resizes the regional managed instance group with advanced configuration
options like disabling creation retries. This is an extended version of theresize method.

If you increase the size, the group creates new instances using the current
instance template. If you decrease the size, the group deletes one or more
instances.

The resize operation is marked DONE if theresize request is successful. The underlying actions take
additional time. You must separately verify the status of thecreating or deleting actions with the get
orlistmanagedinstances
method.

If the group is part of a backend
service that has enabled
connection draining, it can take up to 60 seconds after the connection
draining duration has elapsed before the VM instance is removed or deleted.

group. perInstanceConfig.name serves as a key used to
distinguish whether to perform insert or patch.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

#### `regionInstanceGroupManagers.list()`

Retrieves the list of managed instance groups that are contained
within the specified region.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |

#### `regionInstanceGroupManagers.listManagedInstances()`

Lists the instances in the managed instance group and instances that are
scheduled to be created. The list includes any current actions
that the group has scheduled for its instances. The orderBy
query parameter is not supported.   The `pageToken` query parameter is
supported only if the group's `listManagedInstancesResults` field is set
to `PAGINATED`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request. |
| `params.instanceGroupManager` | `string` | Yes | The name of the managed instance group. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `regionInstanceGroupManagers.startInstances()`

Flags the specified instances in the managed instance group to be
started. This method increases thetargetSize and decreases the targetStoppedSize
of the managed instance group by the number of instances that you start.
The startInstances operation is marked DONE if
the startInstances request is successful. The underlying
actions take additional time. You must separately verify the status of theSTARTING action with thelistmanagedinstances
method.

In this request, you can only specify instances that are stopped. For
example, if an instance was previously stopped using the stopInstances
method, it can be started using the startInstances method.

If a health check is attached to the managed instance group, the specified
instances will be verified as healthy after they are started.

You can specify a maximum of 1000 instances with this method per request.

#### `regionInstanceGroupManagers.update()`

Updates a managed instance group using the information that you specify
in the request.
This operation is marked as DONE when the group is updated
even if the instances in the group have not yet been updated. You must
separately verify the status of the individual instances with thelistmanagedinstances
method.

If you update your group to specify a new template or instance
configuration, it's possible that your intended specification for each VM
in the group is different from the current state of that VM. To learn how
to apply an updated configuration to the VMs in a MIG, seeUpdating instances in
a MIG.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request. |
| `params.instanceGroupManager` | `string` | Yes | The name of the instance group manager. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |

#### `regionInstanceGroupManagers.suspendInstances()`

Flags the specified instances in the managed instance group to be
immediately suspended. You can only specify instances that are running in
this request. This method reduces thetargetSize and increases the targetSuspendedSize
of the managed instance group by the number of instances that you suspend.
The suspendInstances operation is marked DONE if
the suspendInstances request is successful. The underlying
actions take additional time. You must separately verify the status of theSUSPENDING action with thelistmanagedinstances
method.

If the standbyPolicy.initialDelaySec field is set, the group
delays suspension of the instances until initialDelaySec have
passed from instance.creationTimestamp (that is, when the
instance was created). This delay gives your application time to
set itself up and initialize on the instance. If more thaninitialDelaySec seconds have passed sinceinstance.creationTimestamp when this method is called, there
will be zero delay.

If the group is part of a backend
service that has enabled
connection draining, it can take up to 60 seconds after the connection
draining duration has elapsed before the VM instance is suspended.

Suspended instances can be resumed using the resumeInstances
method.

You can specify a maximum of 1000 instances with this method per request.

| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `regionInstanceGroupManagers.setTargetPools()`

#### `regionInstanceGroupManagers.patch()`

Updates a managed instance group using the information that you specify
in the request.
This operation is marked as DONE when the group is patched
even if the instances in the group are still in the process of being
patched. You must separately verify the status of the individual instances
with the listmanagedinstances
method. This method supportsPATCH
semantics and uses theJSON merge
patch format and processing rules.

If you update your group to specify a new template or instance
configuration, it's possible that your intended specification for each VM
in the group is different from the current state of that VM. To learn how
to apply an updated configuration to the VMs in a MIG, seeUpdating instances in
a MIG.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.instanceGroupManager` | `string` | Yes | The name of the instance group manager. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `regionInstanceGroupManagers.stopInstances()`

Flags the specified instances in the managed instance group to be
immediately stopped. You can only specify instances that are running in
this request. This method reduces thetargetSize and increases the targetStoppedSize
of the managed instance group by the number of instances that you stop.
The stopInstances operation is marked DONE if
the stopInstances request is successful. The underlying
actions take additional time. You must separately verify the status of theSTOPPING action with thelistmanagedinstances
method.

If the standbyPolicy.initialDelaySec field is set, the group
delays stopping the instances until initialDelaySec have
passed from instance.creationTimestamp (that is, when the
instance was created). This delay gives your application time to
set itself up and initialize on the instance. If more thaninitialDelaySec seconds have passed sinceinstance.creationTimestamp when this method is called, there
will be zero delay.

If the group is part of a backend
service that has enabled
connection draining, it can take up to 60 seconds after the connection
draining duration has elapsed before the VM instance is stopped.

Stopped instances can be started using the startInstances
method.

You can specify a maximum of 1000 instances with this method per request.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request. |

request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `regionInstanceGroupManagers.recreateInstances()`

Flags the specified VM instances in the managed instance group to be
immediately recreated. Each instance is recreated using the group's current
configuration. This operation is marked as DONE when the flag
is set even if the instances have not yet been recreated. You must
separately verify the status of each instance by checking itscurrentAction field; for more information, see Checking
the status of managed instances.

If the group is part of a backend
service that has enabled
connection draining, it can take up to 60 seconds after the connection
draining duration has elapsed before the VM instance is removed or deleted.

You can specify a maximum of 1000 instances with this method per request.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

| `params.instanceGroupManager` | `string` | Yes | Name of the managed instance group. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `regionInstanceGroupManagers.abandonInstances()`

Flags the specified instances to be immediately removed from the managed
instance group. Abandoning an instance does not delete the
instance, but it does remove the instance from any target pools that are
applied by the managed instance group. This method reduces thetargetSize of the managed instance group by the
number of instances that you abandon. This operation is marked asDONE when the action is scheduled even if the instances have
not yet been removed from the group. You must separately verify the
status of the abandoning action with thelistmanagedinstances
method.

If the group is part of a backend
service that has enabled
connection draining, it can take up to 60 seconds after the connection
draining duration has elapsed before the VM instance is removed or deleted.

You can specify a maximum of 1000 instances with this method per request.

| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `regionInstanceGroupManagers.resumeInstances()`

Flags the specified instances in the managed instance group to be
resumed. This method increases thetargetSize and decreases the targetSuspendedSize
of the managed instance group by the number of instances that you resume.
The resumeInstances operation is marked DONE if
the resumeInstances request is successful. The underlying
actions take additional time. You must separately verify the status of theRESUMING action with thelistmanagedinstances
method.

In this request, you can only specify instances that are suspended. For
example, if an instance was previously suspended using the suspendInstances
method, it can be resumed using the resumeInstances method.

If a health check is attached to the managed instance group, the specified
instances will be verified as healthy after they are resumed.

You can specify a maximum of 1000 instances with this method per request.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so

#### `reservationSubBlocks.list()`

Retrieves a list of reservation subBlocks under a single reservation.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.parentName` | `string` | Yes | The name of the parent reservation and parent block. In the format of
reservations/{reservation_name}/reservationBlocks/{reservation_block_name} |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | Name of the zone for this request. Zone name should conform to RFC1035. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |

### `addresses`

#### `addresses.aggregatedList()`

Retrieves an aggregated list of addresses.

To prevent failure, it is recommended that you set the
`returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which
aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow

| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |

operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |

#### `addresses.delete()`

Deletes the specified address resource.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.address` | `string` | Yes | Name of the address resource to delete. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region for this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |

### `regionNetworkEndpointGroups`

#### `regionNetworkEndpointGroups.listNetworkEndpoints()`

Lists the network endpoints in the specified network endpoint group.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |

#### `nodeTemplates.get()`

Returns the specified node template.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | The name of the region for this request. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.nodeTemplate` | `string` | Yes | Name of the node template to return. |

#### `nodeTemplates.getIamPolicy()`

Gets the access control policy for a resource. May be empty if no such
policy or resource exists.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | The name of the region for this request. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.optionsRequestedPolicyVersion` | `integer` | No | Requested IAM Policy version. |
| `params.resource` | `string` | Yes | Name or id of the resource for this request. |

#### `nodeTemplates.setIamPolicy()`

Sets the access control policy on the specified resource.
Replaces any existing policy.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | The name of the region for this request. |
| `params.resource` | `string` | Yes | Name or id of the resource for this request. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

### `serviceAttachments`

#### `serviceAttachments.patch()`

Patches the specified ServiceAttachment resource with the data included in
the request. This method supports PATCH
semantics and usesJSON merge
patch format and processing rules.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.serviceAttachment` | `string` | Yes | The resource id of the ServiceAttachment to patch. It should conform to
RFC1035 resource name or be a string form on an unsigned long number. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | The region scoping this request and should conform to RFC1035. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `serviceAttachments.list()`

Lists the ServiceAttachments for a project in the given scope.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region of this request. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |

#### `serviceAttachments.insert()`

Creates a ServiceAttachment in the specified project in the given scope
using the parameters that are included in the request.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region of this request. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `serviceAttachments.delete()`

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.serviceAttachment` | `string` | Yes | Name of the ServiceAttachment resource to delete. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region of this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |

#### `serviceAttachments.aggregatedList()`

Retrieves the list of all ServiceAttachment resources,
regional and global, available to the specified project.

`returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which
aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Name of the project scoping this request. |

If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |

#### `regionSslPolicies.insert()`

Creates a new policy in the specified project and region using the data
included in the request.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |

`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |

#### `regionSslPolicies.delete()`

### `globalOperations`

#### `globalOperations.aggregatedList()`

Retrieves an aggregated list of all operations.

To prevent failure, Google recommends that you set the
`returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get

#### `globalOperations.delete()`

Deletes the specified Operations resource.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.operation` | `string` | Yes | Name of the Operations resource to delete, or its unique numeric
identifier. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |

#### `globalOperations.get()`

Retrieves the specified Operations resource.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.operation` | `string` | Yes | Name of the Operations resource to return, or its unique numeric
identifier. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |

#### `globalOperations.wait()`

Waits for the specified Operation resource to return as `DONE`
or for the request to approach the 2 minute deadline, and retrieves the
specified Operation resource. This method differs from the
`GET` method in that it waits for no more than the default
deadline (2 minutes) and then returns the current state of the operation,
which might be `DONE` or still in progress.

This method is called on a best-effort basis. Specifically:
   
   
    - In uncommon cases, when the server is overloaded, the request might
    return before the default deadline is reached, or might return after zero
    seconds.
   - If the default deadline is reached, there is no guarantee that the
    operation is actually done when the method returns. Be prepared to retry
    if the operation is not `DONE`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.operation` | `string` | Yes | Name of the Operations resource to return, or its unique numeric
identifier. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |

### `projects`

#### `projects.getXpnHost()`

Gets the shared VPC host project that this project links to. May be empty
if no link exists.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |

#### `projects.moveDisk()`

Moves a persistent disk from one zone to another.
*Note*: The moveDisk API will be deprecated on September 29, 2026.

Starting September 29, 2025, you can't use the moveDisk API on new
projects. To move a disk to a different region or zone, follow the steps in
[Change the location of a
disk](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/migrate-to-hyperdisk#migrate-to-hd).

Projects that already use the moveDisk API can continue usage until
September 29, 2026.

Starting November 1, 2025, API responses will include a warning message in
the response body about the upcoming deprecation. You can skip the message
to continue using the service without interruption.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

#### `projects.getXpnResources()`

Gets service resources (a.k.a service project) associated with this host
project.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |

#### `projects.setDefaultNetworkTier()`

Sets the default network tier of the project. The default network tier is
used when an address/forwardingRule/instance is created without specifying
the network tier field.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `projects.moveInstance()`

To decrease latency for this method, you can optionally omit any unneeded
information from the response by using a field mask. This practice is
especially recommended for unused quota information (the `quotas` field).
To exclude one or more fields, set your request's `fields` query parameter
to only include the fields you need. For example, to only include the `id`
and `selfLink` fields, add the query parameter `?fields=id,selfLink` to
your request.

The name should conform to RFC1035 or be a resource ID. |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of thezone where the managed
instance group is located. The name should conform to RFC1035. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.instanceGroupManager` | `string` | Yes | The name of the managed instance group to which the resize request will
be added.
Name should conform to RFC1035 or be a resource ID. |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of thezone where the managed
instance group is located and where the resize request will be created.
Name should conform to RFC1035. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `instanceGroupManagerResizeRequests.list()`

Retrieves a list of resize requests that are contained in the
managed instance group.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of thezone where the managed
instance group is located. The name should conform to RFC1035. |
| `params.instanceGroupManager` | `string` | Yes | The name of the managed instance group. The name should conform to RFC1035. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |

| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `externalVpnGateways.list()`

Retrieves the list of ExternalVpnGateway available to the specified
project.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |

#### `externalVpnGateways.get()`

|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |

| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the

|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.replaceExistingAssociation` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether or not to replace it if an association already exists.
This is false by default, in which case an error will be returned if an
association already exists. |
| `params.associatedPolicyToBeReplaced` | `string` | No | Name of the firewall policy associated with the target network to swap
association with. This field is mutually exclusive with

#### `regionNetworkFirewallPolicies.list()`

Lists all the network firewall policies that have been configured
for the specified project in the given region.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
