#### `regionBackendServices.getHealth()`

Gets the most recent health check results for this
regional BackendService.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes |  |
| `params.backendService` | `string` | Yes | Name of the BackendService resource for which to get health. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `regionBackendServices.setSecurityPolicy()`

Sets the Google Cloud Armor security policy for the specified backend
service. For more information, seeGoogle
Cloud Armor Overview

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

#### `regionBackendServices.list()`

Retrieves the list of regional BackendService resources available to the
specified project in the given region.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |

#### `regionBackendServices.update()`

Updates the specified regional BackendService resource with the data
included in the request. For more information,
see 
Backend services overview.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.backendService` | `string` | Yes | Name of the BackendService resource to update. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `regionBackendServices.getIamPolicy()`

Gets the access control policy for a resource. May be empty if no such
policy or resource exists.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | The name of the region for this request. |
| `params.optionsRequestedPolicyVersion` | `integer` | No | Requested IAM Policy version. |
| `params.resource` | `string` | Yes | Name or id of the resource for this request. |

#### `regionBackendServices.listUsable()`

Retrieves a list of all usable backend services in the specified project in
the given region.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request.
It must be a string that meets the requirements in RFC1035. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |

(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`

| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which
aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |

#### `targetHttpsProxies.setUrlMap()`

Changes the URL map for TargetHttpsProxy.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.targetHttpsProxy` | `string` | Yes | Name of the TargetHttpsProxy resource whose URL map is
to be set. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so

| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `targetGrpcProxies.list()`

Lists the TargetGrpcProxies for a project in the given scope.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |

### `interconnectAttachments`

#### `interconnectAttachments.patch()`

Updates the specified interconnect attachment with the data included in the
request. This method supportsPATCH
semantics and uses theJSON merge
patch format and processing rules.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.interconnectAttachment` | `string` | Yes | Name of the interconnect attachment to patch. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request. |

| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which
aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a

are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |

#### `interconnectGroups.getIamPolicy()`

Gets the access control policy for a resource. May be empty if no such
policy or resource exists.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.optionsRequestedPolicyVersion` | `integer` | No | Requested IAM Policy version. |
| `params.resource` | `string` | Yes | Name or id of the resource for this request. |

| `params.resource` | `string` | Yes | Name or id of the resource for this request. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `interconnectGroups.patch()`

Patches the specified InterconnectGroup resource with the data included in
the request. This method supports PATCH
semantics and usesJSON merge
patch format and processing rules.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

|---|---|---|---|
| `params.operation` | `string` | Yes | Name of the Operations resource to delete, or its unique numeric
identifier. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |

#### `globalOperations.wait()`

Waits for the specified Operation resource to return as `DONE`
or for the request to approach the 2 minute deadline, and retrieves the
specified Operation resource. This method differs from the
`GET` method in that it waits for no more than the default
deadline (2 minutes) and then returns the current state of the operation,
which might be `DONE` or still in progress.

This method is called on a best-effort basis. Specifically:
   
   
    - In uncommon cases, when the server is overloaded, the request might
    return before the default deadline is reached, or might return after zero
    seconds.
   - If the default deadline is reached, there is no guarantee that the
    operation is actually done when the method returns. Be prepared to retry
    if the operation is not `DONE`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.operation` | `string` | Yes | Name of the Operations resource to return, or its unique numeric
identifier. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |

#### `globalOperations.aggregatedList()`

`returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |

### `previewFeatures`

#### `previewFeatures.update()`

Patches the given PreviewFeature. This method is used to enable or disable
a PreviewFeature.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.previewFeature` | `string` | Yes | Name of the PreviewFeature for this request. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `previewFeatures.list()`

Returns the details of the given PreviewFeature.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |

For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |

### `interconnectAttachmentGroups`

#### `interconnectAttachmentGroups.patch()`

Patches the specified InterconnectAttachmentGroup resource with the data
included in the request. This method supports PATCH
semantics and usesJSON merge
patch format and processing rules.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the

|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |

### `regionNotificationEndpoints`

| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `resourcePolicies.aggregatedList()`

Retrieves an aggregated list of resource policies.

To prevent failure, Google recommends that you set the
`returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which
aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |

#### `resourcePolicies.setIamPolicy()`

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results

Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of thezone
where the network endpoint group is located. It should comply with RFC1035. |

#### `networkEndpointGroups.delete()`

Deletes the specified network endpoint group. The network endpoints in the
NEG and the VM instances they belong to are not terminated when the NEG is
deleted. Note that the NEG cannot be deleted if there are backend services
referencing it.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.networkEndpointGroup` | `string` | Yes | The name of the network endpoint group to delete. It should comply with
RFC1035. |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of the zone where
the network endpoint group is located. It should comply with RFC1035. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |

#### `networkEndpointGroups.insert()`

Creates a network endpoint group in the specified project using the
parameters that are included in the request.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of the zone where
you want to create the network endpoint group. It should comply with
RFC1035. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `networkEndpointGroups.aggregatedList()`

Retrieves the list of network endpoint groups and sorts them by zone.

To prevent failure, Google recommends that you set the
`returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which
aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |

the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of the zone where
the network endpoint group is located. It should comply with RFC1035. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |

#### `reservationSubBlocks.reportFaulty()`

Allows customers to report a faulty subBlock.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | Name of the zone for this request. Zone name should conform to RFC1035. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.parentName` | `string` | Yes | The name of the parent reservation and parent block. In the format of
reservations/{reservation_name}/reservationBlocks/{reservation_block_name} |
| `params.reservationSubBlock` | `string` | Yes | The name of the reservation subBlock.
Name should conform to RFC1035 or be a resource ID. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

### `instantSnapshots`

#### `instantSnapshots.delete()`

Deletes the specified InstantSnapshot resource. Keep in mind that deleting
a single instantSnapshot might not necessarily delete all the data on that
instantSnapshot. If any data on the instantSnapshot that is marked for
deletion is needed for subsequent instantSnapshots, the data will be moved
to the next corresponding instantSnapshot.

For more information, seeDeleting
instantSnapshots.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.instantSnapshot` | `string` | Yes | Name of the InstantSnapshot resource to delete. |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of the zone for this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |

#### `instantSnapshots.get()`

Returns the specified InstantSnapshot resource in the specified zone.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.instantSnapshot` | `string` | Yes | Name of the InstantSnapshot resource to return. |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of the zone for this request. |

#### `instantSnapshots.aggregatedList()`

Retrieves an aggregated list of instantSnapshots.

To prevent failure, Google recommends that you set the
`returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which
aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |

|---|---|---|---|
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.updateMask` | `string` | No | Indicates fields to be cleared as part of this request. |
| `params.securityPolicy` | `string` | Yes | Name of the security policy to update. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `securityPolicies.listPreconfiguredExpressionSets()`

Gets the current list of preconfigured Web Application Firewall (WAF)
expressions.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |

aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most

| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Name of the project scoping this request. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |

#### `securityPolicies.getRule()`

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.targetHttpProxy` | `string` | Yes | Name of the TargetHttpProxy to set a URL map for. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `regionTargetHttpProxies.delete()`

|---|---|---|---|
| `params.targetHttpProxy` | `string` | Yes | Name of the TargetHttpProxy resource to delete. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and

| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |

#### `regionTargetHttpProxies.list()`

Retrieves the list of TargetHttpProxy resources available
to the specified project in the specified region.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |

#### `targetSslProxies.insert()`

Creates a TargetSslProxy resource in the specified project using
the data included in the request.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

### `instanceSettings`

#### `instanceSettings.patch()`

Patch Instance settings

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The zone scoping this request. It should conform to RFC1035. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.updateMask` | `string` | No | update_mask indicates fields to be updated as part of this request. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `instanceSettings.get()`

Get Instance settings.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | Name of the zone for this request. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |

### `regions`

#### `regions.list()`

Retrieves the list of region resources available to the specified project.

To decrease latency for this method, you can optionally omit any unneeded
information from the response by using a field mask. This practice is
especially recommended for unused quota information
(the `items.quotas` field).
To exclude one or more fields, set your request's `fields` query parameter
to only include the fields you need. For example, to only include the `id`
and `selfLink` fields, add the query parameter `?fields=id,selfLink` to
your request.

This method fails if the quota information is unavailable for the region
and if the organization policy constraint
compute.requireBasicQuotaInResponse is enforced. This
constraint, when enforced, disables the fail-open behaviour when quota
information (the `items.quotas` field) is unavailable for the region.
It is recommended to use the default setting
for the constraint unless your application requires the fail-closed
behaviour for this method.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |

#### `regions.get()`

Returns the specified Region resource.

To decrease latency for this method, you can optionally omit any unneeded
information from the response by using a field mask. This practice is
especially recommended for unused quota information (the `quotas` field).
To exclude one or more fields, set your request's `fields` query parameter
to only include the fields you need. For example, to only include the `id`
and `selfLink` fields, add the query parameter `?fields=id,selfLink` to
your request.

This method fails if the quota information is unavailable for the region
and if the organization policy constraint
compute.requireBasicQuotaInResponse is enforced. This
constraint, when enforced, disables the fail-open behaviour when quota
information (the `items.quotas` field) is unavailable for the region.
It is recommended to use the default setting
for the constraint unless your application requires the fail-closed
behaviour for this method.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |

#### `sslPolicies.delete()`

Deletes the specified SSL policy. The SSL policy resource can be deleted
only if it is not in use by any TargetHttpsProxy or TargetSslProxy
resources.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.sslPolicy` | `string` | Yes | Name of the SSL policy to delete. The name must be 1-63 characters long,
and comply with RFC1035. |

#### `sslPolicies.listAvailableFeatures()`

Lists all features that can be specified in the SSL policy when using
custom profile.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR

(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case

`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |

### `wireGroups`

#### `wireGroups.list()`

Lists the wire groups for a project in the given scope.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.crossSiteNetwork` | `string` | Yes |  |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:

`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |

#### `globalPublicDelegatedPrefixes.get()`

Returns the specified global PublicDelegatedPrefix resource.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.publicDelegatedPrefix` | `string` | Yes | Name of the PublicDelegatedPrefix resource to return. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |

### `regionInstanceGroupManagers`

#### `regionInstanceGroupManagers.patch()`

Updates a managed instance group using the information that you specify
in the request.
This operation is marked as DONE when the group is patched
even if the instances in the group are still in the process of being
patched. You must separately verify the status of the individual instances
with the listmanagedinstances
method. This method supportsPATCH
semantics and uses theJSON merge
patch format and processing rules.

If you update your group to specify a new template or instance
configuration, it's possible that your intended specification for each VM
in the group is different from the current state of that VM. To learn how
to apply an updated configuration to the VMs in a MIG, seeUpdating instances in
a MIG.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.instanceGroupManager` | `string` | Yes | The name of the instance group manager. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `regionInstanceGroupManagers.startInstances()`

Flags the specified instances in the managed instance group to be
started. This method increases thetargetSize and decreases the targetStoppedSize
of the managed instance group by the number of instances that you start.
The startInstances operation is marked DONE if
the startInstances request is successful. The underlying
actions take additional time. You must separately verify the status of theSTARTING action with thelistmanagedinstances
method.

In this request, you can only specify instances that are stopped. For
example, if an instance was previously stopped using the stopInstances
method, it can be started using the startInstances method.

If a health check is attached to the managed instance group, the specified
instances will be verified as healthy after they are started.

You can specify a maximum of 1000 instances with this method per request.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.instanceGroupManager` | `string` | Yes | Name of the managed instance group. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `regionInstanceGroupManagers.insert()`

Creates a managed instance group using the information that you specify
in the request. After the group is created, instances in the group are
created using the specified instance template.
This operation is marked as DONE when the group is created
even if the instances in the group have not yet been created. You must
separately verify the status of the individual instances with thelistmanagedinstances
method.

A regional managed instance group can contain up to 2000 instances.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `regionInstanceGroupManagers.setInstanceTemplate()`

Sets the instance template to use when creating new instances or recreating
instances in this group. Existing instances are not affected.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |

#### `regionInstanceGroupManagers.resize()`

Changes the intended size of the managed instance group. If you increase
the size, the group creates new instances using the current instance
template. If you decrease the size, the group deletes one or more
instances.

The resize operation is marked DONE if theresize request is successful. The underlying actions take
additional time. You must separately verify the status of thecreating or deleting actions with thelistmanagedinstances
method.

If the group is part of a backend
service that has enabled
connection draining, it can take up to 60 seconds after the connection
draining duration has elapsed before the VM instance is removed or deleted.

#### `regionInstanceGroupManagers.recreateInstances()`

Flags the specified VM instances in the managed instance group to be
immediately recreated. Each instance is recreated using the group's current
configuration. This operation is marked as DONE when the flag
is set even if the instances have not yet been recreated. You must
separately verify the status of each instance by checking itscurrentAction field; for more information, see Checking
the status of managed instances.

If the group is part of a backend
service that has enabled
connection draining, it can take up to 60 seconds after the connection
draining duration has elapsed before the VM instance is removed or deleted.

You can specify a maximum of 1000 instances with this method per request.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request. |

#### `regionInstanceGroupManagers.stopInstances()`

Flags the specified instances in the managed instance group to be
immediately stopped. You can only specify instances that are running in
this request. This method reduces thetargetSize and increases the targetStoppedSize
of the managed instance group by the number of instances that you stop.
The stopInstances operation is marked DONE if
the stopInstances request is successful. The underlying
actions take additional time. You must separately verify the status of theSTOPPING action with thelistmanagedinstances
method.

If the standbyPolicy.initialDelaySec field is set, the group
delays stopping the instances until initialDelaySec have
passed from instance.creationTimestamp (that is, when the
instance was created). This delay gives your application time to
set itself up and initialize on the instance. If more thaninitialDelaySec seconds have passed sinceinstance.creationTimestamp when this method is called, there
will be zero delay.

If the group is part of a backend
service that has enabled
connection draining, it can take up to 60 seconds after the connection
draining duration has elapsed before the VM instance is stopped.

Stopped instances can be started using the startInstances
method.

You can specify a maximum of 1000 instances with this method per request.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |

#### `regionInstanceGroupManagers.deleteInstances()`

Flags the specified instances in the managed instance group to be
immediately deleted. The instances are also removed from any target
pools of which they were a member. This method reduces thetargetSize of the managed instance group by the number of
instances that you delete.
The deleteInstances operation is marked DONE if
the deleteInstances request is successful. The underlying
actions take additional time. You must separately verify the status of thedeleting action with thelistmanagedinstances
method.

If the group is part of a backend
service that has enabled
connection draining, it can take up to 60 seconds after the connection
draining duration has elapsed before the VM instance is removed or deleted.

You can specify a maximum of 1000 instances with this method per request.

| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `regionInstanceGroupManagers.resumeInstances()`

Flags the specified instances in the managed instance group to be
resumed. This method increases thetargetSize and decreases the targetSuspendedSize
of the managed instance group by the number of instances that you resume.
The resumeInstances operation is marked DONE if
the resumeInstances request is successful. The underlying
actions take additional time. You must separately verify the status of theRESUMING action with thelistmanagedinstances
method.

In this request, you can only specify instances that are suspended. For
example, if an instance was previously suspended using the suspendInstances
method, it can be resumed using the resumeInstances method.

If a health check is attached to the managed instance group, the specified
instances will be verified as healthy after they are resumed.

You can specify a maximum of 1000 instances with this method per request.

#### `regionInstanceGroupManagers.listManagedInstances()`

Lists the instances in the managed instance group and instances that are
scheduled to be created. The list includes any current actions
that the group has scheduled for its instances. The orderBy
query parameter is not supported.   The `pageToken` query parameter is
supported only if the group's `listManagedInstancesResults` field is set
to `PAGINATED`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.instanceGroupManager` | `string` | Yes | The name of the managed instance group. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |

#### `regionInstanceGroupManagers.get()`

Returns all of the details about the specified managed instance group.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.instanceGroupManager` | `string` | Yes | Name of the managed instance group to return. |

#### `regionInstanceGroupManagers.delete()`

Deletes the specified managed instance group and all of the instances
in that group.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.instanceGroupManager` | `string` | Yes | Name of the managed instance group to delete. |

#### `regionInstanceGroupManagers.list()`

Retrieves the list of managed instance groups that are contained
within the specified region.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case

with an error code. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |

#### `regionInstanceGroupManagers.listErrors()`

| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |

if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request, should conform to RFC1035. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |

#### `regionInstanceGroupManagers.setTargetPools()`

Modifies the target pools to which all new instances in this group are
assigned. Existing instances in the group are not affected.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request. |
| `params.instanceGroupManager` | `string` | Yes | Name of the managed instance group. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `regionInstanceGroupManagers.suspendInstances()`

Flags the specified instances in the managed instance group to be
immediately suspended. You can only specify instances that are running in
this request. This method reduces thetargetSize and increases the targetSuspendedSize
of the managed instance group by the number of instances that you suspend.
The suspendInstances operation is marked DONE if
the suspendInstances request is successful. The underlying
actions take additional time. You must separately verify the status of theSUSPENDING action with thelistmanagedinstances
method.

If the standbyPolicy.initialDelaySec field is set, the group
delays suspension of the instances until initialDelaySec have
passed from instance.creationTimestamp (that is, when the
instance was created). This delay gives your application time to
set itself up and initialize on the instance. If more thaninitialDelaySec seconds have passed sinceinstance.creationTimestamp when this method is called, there
will be zero delay.

If the group is part of a backend
service that has enabled
connection draining, it can take up to 60 seconds after the connection
draining duration has elapsed before the VM instance is suspended.

Suspended instances can be resumed using the resumeInstances
method.

You can specify a maximum of 1000 instances with this method per request.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.instanceGroupManager` | `string` | Yes | Name of the managed instance group. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `regionInstanceGroupManagers.createInstances()`

Creates instances with per-instance configurations in this regional managed
instance group. Instances are created using the current instance template.
The create instances operation is marked DONE if
the createInstances request is successful. The underlying
actions take additional time. You must separately verify the status of thecreating or actions with the listmanagedinstances
method.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.instanceGroupManager` | `string` | Yes | The name of the managed instance group.
It should conform to RFC1035. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | The name of theregion
where the managed instance group is located.
It should conform to RFC1035. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `regionInstanceGroupManagers.deletePerInstanceConfigs()`

group.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.instanceGroupManager` | `string` | Yes | The name of the managed instance group. It should conform to RFC1035. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request, should conform to RFC1035. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `regionInstanceGroupManagers.abandonInstances()`

Flags the specified instances to be immediately removed from the managed
instance group. Abandoning an instance does not delete the
instance, but it does remove the instance from any target pools that are
applied by the managed instance group. This method reduces thetargetSize of the managed instance group by the
number of instances that you abandon. This operation is marked asDONE when the action is scheduled even if the instances have
not yet been removed from the group. You must separately verify the
status of the abandoning action with thelistmanagedinstances
method.

If the group is part of a backend
service that has enabled
connection draining, it can take up to 60 seconds after the connection
draining duration has elapsed before the VM instance is removed or deleted.

You can specify a maximum of 1000 instances with this method per request.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.instanceGroupManager` | `string` | Yes | Name of the managed instance group. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

### `regionOperations`

#### `regionOperations.list()`

Retrieves a list of Operation resources contained within
the specified region.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region for this request. |

#### `regionOperations.wait()`

Waits for the specified Operation resource to return as `DONE`
or for the request to approach the 2 minute deadline, and retrieves the
specified Operation resource. This method differs from the
`GET` method in that it waits for no more than the default
deadline (2 minutes) and then returns the current state of the operation,
which might be `DONE` or still in progress.

This method is called on a best-effort basis. Specifically:
   
   
    - In uncommon cases, when the server is overloaded, the request might
    return before the default deadline is reached, or might return after zero
    seconds.
   - If the default deadline is reached, there is no guarantee that the
    operation is actually done when the method returns. Be prepared to retry
    if the operation is not `DONE`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.operation` | `string` | Yes | Name of the Operations resource to return, or its unique numeric
identifier. |

publicly-available licenses, use this method to make a request to the
respective image project, such as debian-cloud orwindows-cloud.
 *Caution* This resource is intended
for use only by third-party partners who are creatingCloud Marketplace
images.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get

Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:

For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |

a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.disk` | `string` | Yes | Name of the regional persistent disk to delete. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |

#### `regionDisks.startAsyncReplication()`

Starts asynchronous replication.
Must be invoked on the primary disk.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.disk` | `string` | Yes | The name of the persistent disk. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | The name of the region for this request. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `regionDisks.testIamPermissions()`

Returns permissions that a caller has on the specified resource.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.resource` | `string` | Yes | Name or id of the resource for this request. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | The name of the region for this request. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `regionDisks.list()`

Retrieves the list of persistent disks contained within
the specified region.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region for this request. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |

#### `regionDisks.createSnapshot()`

Creates a snapshot of a specified persistent disk. For regular snapshot
creation, consider using snapshots.insert
instead, as that method supports more features, such as creating snapshots
in a project different from the source disk project.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.disk` | `string` | Yes | Name of the regional persistent disk to snapshot. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region for this request. |

the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a

#### `healthChecks.delete()`

Deletes the specified HealthCheck resource.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |

#### `healthChecks.aggregatedList()`

Retrieves the list of all HealthCheck resources, regional and global,
available to the specified project.

To prevent failure, Google recommends that you set the
`returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Name of the project scoping this request. |

| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Name of the project scoping this request. |

request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

#### `networkFirewallPolicies.aggregatedList()`

Retrieves an aggregated list of network firewall policies, listing network
firewall policies from all applicable scopes (global and regional) and
grouping the results per scope.

To prevent failure, it is recommended that you set the
`returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which
aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |

#### `networkFirewallPolicies.patchPacketMirroringRule()`

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.instanceGroupManager` | `string` | Yes | The name of the managed instance group. The name should conform to RFC1035. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |

#### `instanceGroupManagerResizeRequests.get()`

Returns all of the details about the specified resize request.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.instanceGroupManager` | `string` | Yes | The name of the managed instance group.
Name should conform to RFC1035 or be a resource ID. |
| `params.resizeRequest` | `string` | Yes | The name of the resize request.
Name should conform to RFC1035 or be a resource ID. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |

scoping this request. Name should conform to RFC1035. |

### `sslCertificates`

#### `sslCertificates.insert()`

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `sslCertificates.aggregatedList()`

To prevent failure, Google recommends that you set the
`returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can

For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR

| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case

| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Name of the project scoping this request. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which
aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |

the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `routers.listRoutePolicies()`

Retrieves a list of router route policy subresources available to the
specified project.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.router` | `string` | Yes | Name or id of the resource for this request.
Name should conform to RFC1035. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region for this request. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |

#### `zoneOperations.wait()`

Waits for the specified Operation resource to return as `DONE`
or for the request to approach the 2 minute deadline, and retrieves the
specified Operation resource. This method waits for no more than the
2 minutes and then returns the current state of the
operation, which might be `DONE` or still in progress.

This method is called on a best-effort basis. Specifically:
   
   
    - In uncommon cases, when the server is overloaded, the request might
    return before the default deadline is reached, or might return after zero
    seconds.
   - If the default deadline is reached, there is no guarantee that the
    operation is actually done when the method returns. Be prepared to retry
    if the operation is not `DONE`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.operation` | `string` | Yes | Name of the Operations resource to return, or its unique numeric
identifier. |

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |

#### `vpnTunnels.aggregatedList()`

Retrieves an aggregated list of VPN tunnels.

To prevent failure, Google recommends that you set the
`returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which
aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |

#### `vpnTunnels.get()`

that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

| `params.parentId` | `string` | No | Parent ID for this request. The ID can be either be "folders/[FOLDER_ID]"
if the parent is a folder or "organizations/[ORGANIZATION_ID]" if the
parent is an organization. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |

Creates a TargetHttpsProxy resource in the specified project and region
using the data included in the request.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `regionTargetHttpsProxies.setUrlMap()`

| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.targetHttpsProxy` | `string` | Yes | Name of the TargetHttpsProxy resource to return. |

#### `regionTargetHttpsProxies.list()`

Retrieves the list of TargetHttpsProxy resources available
to the specified project in the specified region.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |

#### `regionTargetHttpsProxies.patch()`

the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |

#### `interconnects.get()`

Returns the specified Interconnect. Get a list of available Interconnects
by making a list() request.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.interconnect` | `string` | Yes | Name of the interconnect to return. |

#### `interconnects.insert()`

Creates an Interconnect in the specified project using
the data included in the request.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `interconnects.getDiagnostics()`

Returns the interconnectDiagnostics for the specified
Interconnect.

In the event of a
global outage, do not use this API to make decisions about where to
redirect your network traffic.

Unlike a VLAN attachment, which is regional, a Cloud Interconnect
connection is a global resource. A global outage can prevent this
API from functioning properly.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.interconnect` | `string` | Yes | Name of the interconnect resource to query. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |

#### `interconnects.patch()`

Updates the specified Interconnect with the data included in the request.
This method supportsPATCH
semantics and uses theJSON merge
patch format and processing rules.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.interconnect` | `string` | Yes | Name of the interconnect to update. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `interconnects.getMacsecConfig()`

| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |

#### `interconnects.setLabels()`

Sets the labels on an Interconnect. To learn more about labels,
read the Labeling
Resources documentation.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.resource` | `string` | Yes | Name or id of the resource for this request. |

Returns the specified accelerator type.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.acceleratorType` | `string` | Yes | Name of the accelerator type to return. |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of the zone for this request. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |

#### `acceleratorTypes.aggregatedList()`

Retrieves an aggregated list of accelerator types.

To prevent failure, it is recommended that you set the
`returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which
aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |

| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

#### `regionUrlMaps.list()`

Retrieves the list of UrlMap resources available to the specified
project in the specified region.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request. |

#### `regionUrlMaps.insert()`

| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `regionUrlMaps.patch()`

request. This method supportsPATCH
semantics and usesJSON merge
patch format and processing rules.

(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.image` | `string` | Yes | Image name. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `images.list()`

Retrieves the list of custom images
available to the specified project. Custom images are images you
create that belong to your project. This method does not
get any images that belong to other projects, including publicly-available
images, like Debian 8. If you want to get a list of publicly-available
images, use this method to make a request to the respective image project,
such as debian-cloud or windows-cloud.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |

#### `images.setIamPolicy()`

Sets the access control policy on the specified resource.
Replaces any existing policy.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|

| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

### `instanceGroupManagers`

#### `instanceGroupManagers.setTargetPools()`

Modifies the target pools to which all instances in this managed instance
group are assigned. The target pools automatically apply to all of the
instances in the managed instance group. This operation is markedDONE when you make the request even if the instances have not
yet been added to their target pools. The change might take some time to
apply to all of the instances in the group depending on the size of the
group.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of thezone where the managed
instance group is located. |

instance group is located. |
| `params.instanceGroupManager` | `string` | Yes | The name of the managed instance group to delete. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |

#### `instanceGroupManagers.patchPerInstanceConfigs()`

Inserts or patches per-instance configurations for the managed instance
group. perInstanceConfig.name serves as a key used to
distinguish whether to perform insert or patch.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the

It should conform to RFC1035. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `instanceGroupManagers.abandonInstances()`

Flags the specified instances to be removed from the
managed instance group. Abandoning an instance does not delete the
instance, but it does remove the instance from any target pools that are
applied by the managed instance group. This method reduces thetargetSize of the managed instance group by the
number of instances that you abandon. This operation is marked asDONE when the action is scheduled even if the instances have
not yet been removed from the group. You must separately verify the
status of the abandoning action with thelistmanagedinstances
method.

If the group is part of a backend
service that has enabled
connection draining, it can take up to 60 seconds after the connection
draining duration has elapsed before the VM instance is removed or deleted.

You can specify a maximum of 1000 instances with this method per request.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.instanceGroupManager` | `string` | Yes | The name of the managed instance group. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of thezone where the managed
instance group is located. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `instanceGroupManagers.resize()`

Resizes the managed instance group. If you increase the size, the group
creates new instances using the current instance template. If you decrease
the size, the group deletes instances. The resize operation is markedDONE when the resize actions are scheduled even if the group
has not yet added or deleted any instances. You must separately
verify the status of the creating or deleting
actions with thelistmanagedinstances
method.

When resizing down, the instance group arbitrarily chooses the order in
which VMs are deleted. The group takes into account some VM attributes when
making the selection including:

+ The status of the VM instance.
+ The health of the VM instance.
+ The instance template version the VM is based on.
+ For regional managed instance groups, the location of the VM instance.

This list is subject to change.

If the group is part of a backend
service that has enabled
connection draining, it can take up to 60 seconds after the connection
draining duration has elapsed before the VM instance is removed or deleted.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of thezone where the managed
instance group is located. |
| `params.size` | `integer` | Yes | The number of running instances that the managed instance group should
maintain at any given time. The group automatically adds or removes
instances to maintain the number of instances specified by this parameter. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.instanceGroupManager` | `string` | Yes | The name of the managed instance group. |

#### `instanceGroupManagers.recreateInstances()`

Flags the specified VM instances in the managed instance group to be
immediately recreated. Each instance is recreated using the group's current
configuration. This operation is marked as DONE when the flag
is set even if the instances have not yet been recreated. You must
separately verify the status of each instance by checking itscurrentAction field; for more information, see Checking
the status of managed instances.

If the group is part of a backend
service that has enabled
connection draining, it can take up to 60 seconds after the connection
draining duration has elapsed before the VM instance is removed or deleted.

You can specify a maximum of 1000 instances with this method per request.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of thezone where the managed
instance group is located. |
| `params.instanceGroupManager` | `string` | Yes | The name of the managed instance group. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `instanceGroupManagers.stopInstances()`

Flags the specified instances in the managed instance group to be
immediately stopped. You can only specify instances that are running in
this request. This method reduces thetargetSize and increases the targetStoppedSize
of the managed instance group by the number of instances that you stop.
The stopInstances operation is marked DONE if
the stopInstances request is successful. The underlying
actions take additional time. You must separately verify the status of theSTOPPING action with thelistmanagedinstances
method.

If the standbyPolicy.initialDelaySec field is set, the group
delays stopping the instances until initialDelaySec have
passed from instance.creationTimestamp (that is, when the
instance was created). This delay gives your application time to
set itself up and initialize on the instance. If more thaninitialDelaySec seconds have passed sinceinstance.creationTimestamp when this method is called, there
will be zero delay.

If the group is part of a backend
service that has enabled
connection draining, it can take up to 60 seconds after the connection
draining duration has elapsed before the VM instance is stopped.

Stopped instances can be started using the startInstances
method.

You can specify a maximum of 1000 instances with this method per request.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of thezone where the managed
instance group is located. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.instanceGroupManager` | `string` | Yes | The name of the managed instance group. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `instanceGroupManagers.aggregatedList()`

Retrieves the list of managed instance groups and groups them by zone.

To prevent failure, Google recommends that you set the
`returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which
aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |

#### `instanceGroupManagers.createInstances()`

Creates instances with per-instance configurations in this managed instance
group. Instances are created using the current instance template. Thecreate instances operation is marked DONE if thecreateInstances request is successful. The underlying actions

request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |

| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `instanceGroupManagers.deleteInstances()`

Flags the specified instances in the managed instance group for immediate
deletion. The instances are also removed from any target
pools of which they were a member. This method reduces thetargetSize of the managed instance group by the number of
instances that you delete. This operation is marked as DONE
when the action is scheduled even if the instances are still being deleted.
You must separately verify the status of the deleting action
with thelistmanagedinstances
method.

If the group is part of a backend
service that has enabled
connection draining, it can take up to 60 seconds after the connection
draining duration has elapsed before the VM instance is removed or deleted.

You can specify a maximum of 1000 instances with this method per request.

the next page of results. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |

`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |

#### `instanceGroupManagers.startInstances()`

Flags the specified instances in the managed instance group to be
started. This method increases thetargetSize and decreases the targetStoppedSize
of the managed instance group by the number of instances that you start.
The startInstances operation is marked DONE if
the startInstances request is successful. The underlying
actions take additional time. You must separately verify the status of theSTARTING action with thelistmanagedinstances
method.

In this request, you can only specify instances that are stopped. For
example, if an instance was previously stopped using the stopInstances
method, it can be started using the startInstances method.

If a health check is attached to the managed instance group, the specified
instances will be verified as healthy after they are started.

You can specify a maximum of 1000 instances with this method per request.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of thezone where the managed
instance group is located. |
| `params.instanceGroupManager` | `string` | Yes | The name of the managed instance group. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `instanceGroupManagers.suspendInstances()`

Flags the specified instances in the managed instance group to be
immediately suspended. You can only specify instances that are running in
this request. This method reduces thetargetSize and increases the targetSuspendedSize
of the managed instance group by the number of instances that you suspend.
The suspendInstances operation is marked DONE if
the suspendInstances request is successful. The underlying
actions take additional time. You must separately verify the status of theSUSPENDING action with thelistmanagedinstances
method.

If the standbyPolicy.initialDelaySec field is set, the group
delays suspension of the instances until initialDelaySec have
passed from instance.creationTimestamp (that is, when the
instance was created). This delay gives your application time to
set itself up and initialize on the instance. If more thaninitialDelaySec seconds have passed sinceinstance.creationTimestamp when this method is called, there
will be zero delay.

If the group is part of a backend
service that has enabled
connection draining, it can take up to 60 seconds after the connection
draining duration has elapsed before the VM instance is suspended.

Suspended instances can be resumed using the resumeInstances
method.

You can specify a maximum of 1000 instances with this method per request.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of thezone where the managed
instance group is located. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.instanceGroupManager` | `string` | Yes | The name of the managed instance group. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `instanceGroupManagers.listPerInstanceConfigs()`

Lists all of the per-instance configurations defined for the managed
instance group. The orderBy query parameter is not supported.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of thezone
where the managed instance group is located.
It should conform to RFC1035. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.instanceGroupManager` | `string` | Yes | The name of the managed instance group. It should conform to RFC1035. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |

#### `instanceGroupManagers.list()`

Retrieves a list of managed instance groups that are contained within the
specified project and zone.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

#### `instanceGroupManagers.insert()`

Creates a managed instance group using the information that you specify
in the request. After the group is created, instances in the group are
created using the specified instance template.
This operation is marked as DONE when the group is created
even if the instances in the group have not yet been created. You
must separately verify the status of the individual instances with thelistmanagedinstances
method.

A managed instance group can have up to 1000 VM instances per group. Please
contact Cloud Support if you need an increase in
this limit.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of the zone
where you want to create the managed instance group. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `instanceGroupManagers.patch()`

Updates a managed instance group using the information that you specify
in the request.
This operation is marked as DONE when the group is patched
even if the instances in the group are still in the process of being
patched. You must separately verify the status of the individual instances
with thelistManagedInstances
method. This method supportsPATCH
semantics and uses theJSON merge
patch format and processing rules.

If you update your group to specify a new template or instance
configuration, it's possible that your intended specification for each VM
in the group is different from the current state of that VM. To learn how
to apply an updated configuration to the VMs in a MIG, seeUpdating instances in
a MIG.

#### `instanceGroupManagers.resumeInstances()`

Flags the specified instances in the managed instance group to be
resumed. This method increases thetargetSize and decreases the targetSuspendedSize
of the managed instance group by the number of instances that you resume.
The resumeInstances operation is marked DONE if
the resumeInstances request is successful. The underlying
actions take additional time. You must separately verify the status of theRESUMING action with thelistmanagedinstances
method.

In this request, you can only specify instances that are suspended. For
example, if an instance was previously suspended using the suspendInstances
method, it can be resumed using the resumeInstances method.

If a health check is attached to the managed instance group, the specified
instances will be verified as healthy after they are resumed.

You can specify a maximum of 1000 instances with this method per request.

Lists all of the instances in the managed instance group. Each instance
in the list has a currentAction, which indicates the action
that the managed instance group is performing on the instance. For example,
if the group is still creating an instance, the currentAction
is CREATING. If a previous action failed, the
list displays the errors for that failed action. The orderBy
query parameter is not supported. The `pageToken` query parameter is
supported only if the group's `listManagedInstancesResults` field is set

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request. |

### `networkProfiles`

#### `networkProfiles.list()`

Retrieves a list of network profiles available to the specified
project.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

included in the request.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |

the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the

| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |

single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |

#### `nodeTemplates.insert()`

Creates a NodeTemplate resource in the specified project using the data
included in the request.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |

### `regionZones`

#### `regionZones.list()`

Retrieves the list of Zone resources under the specific region available to

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Region for this request. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |

request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

instances have no compute costs (cores or RAM), and incur only storage
charges for the saved VM memory and localSSD data. Any charged resources
the virtual machine was using, such as persistent disks and static IP
addresses, will continue to be charged while the instance is suspended.
For more information, see
Suspending and resuming an instance.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |

#### `instances.list()`

Retrieves the list of instances contained within
the specified zone.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of the zone for this request. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |

#### `instances.listReferrers()`

Retrieves a list of resources that refer to the VM instance specified in
the request. For example, if the VM instance is part of a managed or
unmanaged instance group, the referrers list includes the instance group.
For more information, readViewing
referrers to VM instances.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most

| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.instance` | `string` | Yes | Name of the target instance scoping this request, or '-' if the
request should span over all instances in the container. |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of the zone for this request. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results

#### `instances.deleteAccessConfig()`

Deletes an access config from an instance's network interface.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.accessConfig` | `string` | Yes | The name of the access config to delete. |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of the zone for this request. |

#### `instances.aggregatedList()`

Retrieves an aggregated list of all of the instances in your project
across all regions and zones.

The performance of this method degrades when a filter is specified on a
project that has a very large number of instances.

To prevent failure, Google recommends that you set the
`returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which
aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |

#### `instances.setMinCpuPlatform()`

can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region of this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |

### `disks`

#### `disks.createSnapshot()`

Creates a snapshot of a specified persistent disk. For regular snapshot
creation, consider using snapshots.insert
instead, as that method supports more features, such as creating snapshots
in a project different from the source disk project.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of the zone for this request. |
| `params.guestFlush` | `boolean` | No | [Input Only] Whether to attempt an application consistent snapshot by
informing the OS to prepare for the snapshot process. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.disk` | `string` | Yes | Name of the persistent disk to snapshot. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `disks.get()`

Returns the specified persistent disk.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of the zone for this request. |
| `params.disk` | `string` | Yes | Name of the persistent disk to return. |

#### `disks.removeResourcePolicies()`

Removes resource policies from a disk.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.disk` | `string` | Yes | The disk name for this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of the zone for this request. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

|---|---|---|---|
| `params.resource` | `string` | Yes | Name or id of the resource for this request. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of the zone for this request. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `disks.aggregatedList()`

Retrieves an aggregated list of persistent disks.

To prevent failure, it is recommended that you set the
`returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which
aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |

#### `disks.testIamPermissions()`

| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |

#### `globalAddresses.move()`

Moves the specified address resource from one project to another project.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering

The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation

| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `targetPools.aggregatedList()`

Retrieves an aggregated list of target pools.

To prevent failure, Google recommends that you set the
`returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which
aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |

#### `targetPools.removeInstance()`

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |

for the specified project in the given region.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |

#### `targetTcpProxies.list()`

Retrieves the list of TargetTcpProxy resources
available to the specified project.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |

#### `targetTcpProxies.aggregatedList()`

Retrieves the list of all TargetTcpProxy resources, regional and global,
available to the specified project.

To prevent failure, Google recommends that you set the
`returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Name of the project scoping this request. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which
aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |

#### `nodeTypes.list()`

Retrieves a list of node types available to the specified
project.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of the zone for this request. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |

Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:

labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |

Creates a commitment in the specified project using the data
included in the request.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region for this request. |

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |

`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |

#### `nodeGroups.testIamPermissions()`

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |

| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |

#### `subnetworks.aggregatedList()`

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.views` | `string` | No | Defines the extra views returned back in the subnetwork resource.
Supported values:
   
   - WITH_UTILIZATION: Utilization data is included in the
   response. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which
aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |

### `organizationSecurityPolicies`

#### `organizationSecurityPolicies.removeAssociation()`

request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of the zone for this request. |
| `params.storagePool` | `string` | Yes | Name of the storage pool to delete. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |

#### `storagePools.insert()`

Creates a storage pool in the specified project using the data
in the request.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of the zone for this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so

| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `storagePools.setIamPolicy()`

Sets the access control policy on the specified resource.
Replaces any existing policy.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.resource` | `string` | Yes | Name or id of the resource for this request. |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of the zone for this request. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `storagePools.list()`

Retrieves a list of storage pools contained within
the specified zone.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of the zone for this request. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |

#### `storagePools.aggregatedList()`

Retrieves an aggregated list of storage pools.

To prevent failure, Google recommends that you set the
`returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

with an error code. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get

| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region for this request. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `publicDelegatedPrefixes.get()`

Returns the specified PublicDelegatedPrefix resource in the given region.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.publicDelegatedPrefix` | `string` | Yes | Name of the PublicDelegatedPrefix resource to return. |

#### `publicDelegatedPrefixes.withdraw()`

Withdraws the specified PublicDelegatedPrefix in the given region.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | The name of theregion where
the public delegated prefix is located. It should comply with RFC1035. |

request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |

#### `instanceGroups.aggregatedList()`

Retrieves the list of instance groups and sorts them by zone.

To prevent failure, Google recommends that you set the
`returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which
aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |

#### `instanceGroups.listInstances()`

Lists the instances in the specified instance group.
The orderBy query parameter is not supported.
The filter query parameter is supported, but only for
expressions that use `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operators.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.instanceGroup` | `string` | Yes | The name of the instance group from which you want to generate a list
of included instances. |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of the zone
where the instance group is located. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `instanceGroups.removeInstances()`

Removes one or more instances from the specified instance group, but does
not delete those instances.

If the group is part of a backend
service that has enabled
connection draining, it can take up to 60 seconds after the connection
draining duration before the VM instance is removed or deleted.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.instanceGroup` | `string` | Yes | The name of the instance group where the specified instances will be
removed. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |

| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |

#### `snapshots.setLabels()`

Sets the labels on a snapshot. To learn more about labels, read theLabeling
Resources documentation.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.resource` | `string` | Yes | Name or id of the resource for this request. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `snapshots.delete()`

Deletes the specified Snapshot resource. Keep in mind that deleting
a single snapshot might not necessarily delete all the data on that
snapshot. If any data on the snapshot that is marked for deletion is
needed for subsequent snapshots, the data will be moved to the next
corresponding snapshot.

For more information, seeDeleting
snapshots.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.snapshot` | `string` | Yes | Name of the Snapshot resource to delete. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |

#### `snapshots.insert()`

Creates a snapshot in the specified project using the data included
in the request. For regular snapshot creation, consider using this method
instead of disks.createSnapshot,
as this method supports more features, such as creating snapshots in a
project different from the source disk project.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `snapshots.setIamPolicy()`

| `params.targetInstance` | `string` | Yes | Name of the TargetInstance resource to return. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |

#### `targetInstances.aggregatedList()`

Retrieves an aggregated list of target instances.

To prevent failure, Google recommends that you set the
`returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which
aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |

#### `targetInstances.insert()`

the data included in the request.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | Name of the zone scoping this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region of this request. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `serviceAttachments.aggregatedList()`

Retrieves the list of all ServiceAttachment resources,
regional and global, available to the specified project.

To prevent failure, Google recommends that you set the
`returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which
aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Name of the project scoping this request. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |

#### `serviceAttachments.list()`

Lists the ServiceAttachments for a project in the given scope.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |

the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the

#### `regionNetworkEndpointGroups.list()`

Retrieves the list of regional network endpoint groups available to the
specified project in the given region.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | The name of theregion
where the network endpoint group is located. It should comply with RFC1035. |

#### `regionNetworkEndpointGroups.detachNetworkEndpoints()`

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |

| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource

that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.reservation` | `string` | Yes | The name of the reservation.

#### `reservations.aggregatedList()`

Retrieves an aggregated list of reservations.

To prevent failure, it is recommended that you set the
`returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which
aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |

#### `reservations.insert()`

Creates a new reservation. For more information, readReserving zonal
resources.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | Name of the zone for this request. |

#### `projects.get()`

Returns the specified Project resource.

To decrease latency for this method, you can optionally omit any unneeded
information from the response by using a field mask. This practice is
especially recommended for unused quota information (the `quotas` field).
To exclude one or more fields, set your request's `fields` query parameter
to only include the fields you need. For example, to only include the `id`
and `selfLink` fields, add the query parameter `?fields=id,selfLink` to
your request.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.sslPolicy` | `string` | Yes | Name of the SSL policy to update. The name must be 1-63 characters long,
and comply with RFC1035. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `regionSslPolicies.list()`

Lists all the SSL policies that have been configured for the specified
project and region.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |

included in the request.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same

`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |

#### `publicAdvertisedPrefixes.withdraw()`

Withdraws the specified PublicAdvertisedPrefix

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.publicAdvertisedPrefix` | `string` | Yes | The name of the public advertised prefix. It should comply with RFC1035. |

#### `publicAdvertisedPrefixes.get()`

Returns the specified PublicAdvertisedPrefix resource.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |

| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.publicAdvertisedPrefix` | `string` | Yes | The name of the public advertised prefix. It should comply with RFC1035. |

### `urlMaps`

#### `urlMaps.validate()`

Runs static validation for the UrlMap. In particular, the tests of the
provided UrlMap will be run. Calling this method does NOT create the
UrlMap.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.urlMap` | `string` | Yes | Name of the UrlMap resource to be validated as. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `urlMaps.get()`

Returns the specified UrlMap resource.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.urlMap` | `string` | Yes | Name of the UrlMap resource to return. |

#### `urlMaps.list()`

Retrieves the list of UrlMap resources available to the specified
project.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |

#### `urlMaps.insert()`

Creates a UrlMap resource in the specified project using
the data included in the request.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `urlMaps.invalidateCache()`

|---|---|---|---|
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This

| `params.urlMap` | `string` | Yes | Name of the UrlMap scoping this request. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `urlMaps.aggregatedList()`

Retrieves the list of all UrlMap resources, regional and global,
available to the specified project.

To prevent failure, Google recommends that you set the
`returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Name of the project scoping this request. |
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which
aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |

#### `httpsHealthChecks.list()`

Retrieves the list of HttpsHealthCheck resources available to the specified
project.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the

the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
