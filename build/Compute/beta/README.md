## API Reference

### `regionHealthCheckServices`

#### `regionHealthCheckServices.testIamPermissions()`

Returns permissions that a caller has on the specified resource.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.resource` | `string` | Yes | Name or id of the resource for this request. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | The name of the region for this request. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `regionHealthCheckServices.delete()`

Deletes the specified regional HealthCheckService.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request. |
| `params.healthCheckService` | `string` | Yes | Name of the HealthCheckService to delete. The name
must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |

#### `regionHealthCheckServices.patch()`

Updates the specified regional HealthCheckService resource
with the data included in the request.  This method supportsPATCH
semantics and uses theJSON merge
patch format and processing rules.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.healthCheckService` | `string` | Yes | Name of the HealthCheckService to update. The name
must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `regionHealthCheckServices.insert()`

Creates a regional HealthCheckService resource in the
specified project and region using the data included in the request.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request. |

| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `regionHealthCheckServices.get()`

Returns the specified regional HealthCheckService resource.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request. |
| `params.healthCheckService` | `string` | Yes | Name of the HealthCheckService to update. The name
must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |

#### `regionHealthCheckServices.list()`

Lists all the HealthCheckService resources that have been
configured for the specified project in the given region.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request. |

### `machineTypes`

#### `machineTypes.aggregatedList()`

Retrieves an aggregated list of machine types.

To prevent failure, Google recommends that you set the
`returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which
aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort

#### `wireGroups.patch()`

Updates the specified wire group resource with the data included in the
request. This method supportsPATCH
semantics and usesJSON merge
patch format and processing rules.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

#### `vpnGateways.list()`

Retrieves a list of VPN gateways available to the specified
project and region.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region for this request. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |

`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case

(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |

#### `zones.get()`

Returns the specified Zone resource.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | Name of the zone resource to return. |

### `imageFamilyViews`

#### `imageFamilyViews.get()`

Returns the latest image that is part of an image family, is not
deprecated and is rolled out in the specified zone.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of the zone for this request. |
| `params.family` | `string` | Yes | Name of the image family to search for. |

### `httpsHealthChecks`

#### `httpsHealthChecks.delete()`

Deletes the specified HttpsHealthCheck resource.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.httpsHealthCheck` | `string` | Yes | Name of the HttpsHealthCheck resource to delete. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |

#### `httpsHealthChecks.testIamPermissions()`

included in the request.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.httpsHealthCheck` | `string` | Yes | Name of the HttpsHealthCheck resource to update. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so

request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `httpsHealthChecks.list()`

Retrieves the list of HttpsHealthCheck resources available to the specified
project.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.instanceGroupManager` | `string` | Yes | The name of the managed instance group. The name should conform to RFC1035. |

#### `regionInstanceGroupManagerResizeRequests.get()`

Returns all of the details about the specified resize request.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | The name of the region
scoping this request. Name should conform to RFC1035. |
| `params.resizeRequest` | `string` | Yes | The name of the resize request.
Name should conform to RFC1035 or be a resource ID. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.instanceGroupManager` | `string` | Yes | The name of the managed instance group.
Name should conform to RFC1035 or be a resource ID. |

#### `regionInstanceGroupManagerResizeRequests.delete()`

Deletes the specified, inactive resize request. Requests that are still
active cannot be deleted. Deleting request does not delete instances that
were provisioned previously.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |

(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.instanceGroupManager` | `string` | Yes | Name of the managed instance group to which the resize request is scoped.
Name should conform to RFC1035 or be a resource ID. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region
scoping this request. Name should conform to RFC1035. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

### `regionCommitments`

#### `regionCommitments.list()`

Retrieves a list of commitments contained within
the specified region.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region for this request. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |

#### `regionCommitments.insert()`

Creates a commitment in the specified project using the data
included in the request.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region for this request. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `regionCommitments.aggregatedList()`

Retrieves an aggregated list of commitments by region.

To prevent failure, it is recommended that you set the
`returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in

aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This

| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |

reservations/{reservation_name}/reservationBlocks/{reservation_block_name} |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | Name of the zone for this request. Zone name should conform to RFC1035. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |

#### `reservationSubBlocks.getIamPolicy()`

| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of the zone where
the network endpoint group is located. It should comply with RFC1035. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `networkEndpointGroups.get()`

Returns the specified network endpoint group.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.networkEndpointGroup` | `string` | Yes | The name of the network endpoint group. It should comply with RFC1035. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of the zone where
the network endpoint group is located. It should comply with RFC1035. |

#### `networkEndpointGroups.aggregatedList()`

Retrieves the list of network endpoint groups and sorts them by zone.

To prevent failure, Google recommends that you set the
`returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which
aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |

(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |

#### `autoscalers.list()`

Retrieves a list of autoscalers contained within
the specified zone.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | Name of the zone for this request. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |

#### `autoscalers.update()`

Updates an autoscaler in the specified project using the data
included in the request.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |

#### `autoscalers.aggregatedList()`

Retrieves an aggregated list of autoscalers.

To prevent failure, it is recommended that you set the
`returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.targetTcpProxy` | `string` | Yes | Name of the TargetTcpProxy resource to delete. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |

#### `regionTargetTcpProxies.testIamPermissions()`

Returns permissions that a caller has on the specified resource.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | The name of the region for this request. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.resource` | `string` | Yes | Name or id of the resource for this request. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `regionTargetTcpProxies.list()`

Retrieves a list of TargetTcpProxy resources
available to the specified project in a given region.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |

`returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |

exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which
aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |

#### `forwardingRules.insert()`

Creates a ForwardingRule resource in the specified project and region using
the data included in the request.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.snapshot` | `string` | Yes | Name of the Snapshot resource to return. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |

#### `snapshots.insert()`

Creates a snapshot in the specified project using the data included
in the request. For regular snapshot creation, consider using this method
instead of disks.createSnapshot,
as this method supports more features, such as creating snapshots in a
project different from the source disk project.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `snapshots.aggregatedList()`

Retrieves an aggregated list of all of the snapshots in your project
across all regions and global scope.

To prevent failure, Google recommends that you set the
`returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:

of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which
aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |

#### `snapshots.testIamPermissions()`

request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `targetTcpProxies.list()`

Retrieves the list of TargetTcpProxy resources
available to the specified project.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |

timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort

| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which
aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a

(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.

(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |

| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |

#### `urlMaps.aggregatedList()`

Retrieves the list of all UrlMap resources, regional and global,
available to the specified project.

To prevent failure, Google recommends that you set the
`returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which
aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.firewallPolicy` | `string` | Yes | Name of the firewall policy to get. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |

#### `networkFirewallPolicies.list()`

Lists all the policies that have been configured for the specified project.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |

#### `networkFirewallPolicies.delete()`

Deletes the specified policy.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.firewallPolicy` | `string` | Yes | Name of the firewall policy to delete. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |

#### `networkFirewallPolicies.aggregatedList()`

Retrieves an aggregated list of network firewall policies, listing network
firewall policies from all applicable scopes (global and regional) and
grouping the results per scope.

To prevent failure, it is recommended that you set the
`returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which
aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |

`returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which
aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Name of the project scoping this request. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |

#### `healthChecks.delete()`

Deletes the specified HealthCheck resource.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.healthCheck` | `string` | Yes | Name of the HealthCheck resource to delete. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |

#### `organizationSecurityPolicies.list()`

List all the policies that have been configured for the specified
organization.

Use of this API to read firewall policies is deprecated. Use
firewallPolicies.list instead.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |

`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |

that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This

#### `organizationSecurityPolicies.listAssociations()`

Lists associations of a specified target, i.e., organization or folder.

Use of this API to read firewall policies is deprecated. Use
firewallPolicies.listAssociations instead if possible.

| `params.targetResource` | `string` | No | The target resource to list associations. It is an organization, or a
folder. |

#### `organizationSecurityPolicies.listPreconfiguredExpressionSets()`

Gets the current list of preconfigured Web Application Firewall (WAF)
expressions.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.parentId` | `string` | No | Parent ID for this request. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |

#### `organizationSecurityPolicies.getAssociation()`

|---|---|---|---|
| `params.name` | `string` | No | The name of the association to get from the security policy. |
| `params.securityPolicy` | `string` | Yes | Name of the security policy to which the queried rule belongs. |

#### `organizationSecurityPolicies.removeRule()`

Deletes a rule at the specified priority.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.securityPolicy` | `string` | Yes | Name of the security policy to update. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.priority` | `integer` | No | The priority of the rule to remove from the security policy. |

#### `organizationSecurityPolicies.move()`

Moves the specified security policy.

Use of this API to modify firewall policies is deprecated. Use
firewallPolicies.move instead.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.securityPolicy` | `string` | Yes | Name of the security policy to update. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.parentId` | `string` | No | The new parent of the security policy. |

### `regionNetworkEndpointGroups`

#### `regionNetworkEndpointGroups.list()`

Retrieves the list of regional network endpoint groups available to the
specified project in the given region.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | The name of theregion
where the network endpoint group is located. It should comply with RFC1035. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |

| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `regionBackendServices.list()`

Retrieves the list of regional BackendService resources available to the
specified project in the given region.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request. |

#### `regionBackendServices.testIamPermissions()`

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.backendService` | `string` | Yes | Name of the BackendService resource to delete. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |

| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which
aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |

| `params.networkAttachment` | `string` | Yes | Name of the NetworkAttachment resource to delete. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be

Retrieves the specified zone-specific Operations resource.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.operation` | `string` | Yes | Name of the Operations resource to return, or its unique numeric
identifier. |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | Name of the zone for this request. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |

#### `zoneOperations.list()`

Retrieves a list of Operation resources contained within
the specified zone.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | Name of the zone for request. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |

#### `zoneOperations.wait()`

Waits for the specified Operation resource to return as `DONE`
or for the request to approach the 2 minute deadline, and retrieves the
specified Operation resource. This method waits for no more than the
2 minutes and then returns the current state of the
operation, which might be `DONE` or still in progress.

This method is called on a best-effort basis. Specifically:
   
   
    - In uncommon cases, when the server is overloaded, the request might
    return before the default deadline is reached, or might return after zero
    seconds.
   - If the default deadline is reached, there is no guarantee that the
    operation is actually done when the method returns. Be prepared to retry
    if the operation is not `DONE`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.operation` | `string` | Yes | Name of the Operations resource to return, or its unique numeric
identifier. |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | Name of the zone for this request. |

`returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |

| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |

| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of the zone for this request. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |

#### `diskTypes.get()`

Returns the specified disk type.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.diskType` | `string` | Yes | Name of the disk type to return. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of the zone for this request. |

#### `diskTypes.aggregatedList()`

Retrieves an aggregated list of disk types.

To prevent failure, it is recommended that you set the
`returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which
aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |

### `targetHttpsProxies`

available to the specified project.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |

#### `reservations.aggregatedList()`

Retrieves an aggregated list of reservations.

To prevent failure, it is recommended that you set the
`returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which
aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |

| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

### `httpHealthChecks`

#### `httpHealthChecks.get()`

Returns the specified HttpHealthCheck resource.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.httpHealthCheck` | `string` | Yes | Name of the HttpHealthCheck resource to return. |

#### `httpHealthChecks.patch()`

Updates a HttpHealthCheck resource in the specified project using the data
included in the request. This method supportsPATCH
semantics and uses theJSON merge
patch format and processing rules.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.httpHealthCheck` | `string` | Yes | Name of the HttpHealthCheck resource to patch. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |

#### `httpHealthChecks.list()`

Retrieves the list of HttpHealthCheck resources available to the specified
project.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |

| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `sslPolicies.list()`

Lists all the SSL policies that have been configured for the specified
project.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |

### `targetSslProxies`

#### `targetSslProxies.delete()`

Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |

### `globalOperations`

#### `globalOperations.aggregatedList()`

Retrieves an aggregated list of all operations.

To prevent failure, Google recommends that you set the
`returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most

#### `globalOperations.get()`

Retrieves the specified Operations resource.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.operation` | `string` | Yes | Name of the Operations resource to return, or its unique numeric
identifier. |

#### `globalOperations.wait()`

Waits for the specified Operation resource to return as `DONE`
or for the request to approach the 2 minute deadline, and retrieves the
specified Operation resource. This method differs from the
`GET` method in that it waits for no more than the default
deadline (2 minutes) and then returns the current state of the operation,
which might be `DONE` or still in progress.

This method is called on a best-effort basis. Specifically:
   
   
    - In uncommon cases, when the server is overloaded, the request might
    return before the default deadline is reached, or might return after zero
    seconds.
   - If the default deadline is reached, there is no guarantee that the
    operation is actually done when the method returns. Be prepared to retry
    if the operation is not `DONE`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.operation` | `string` | Yes | Name of the Operations resource to return, or its unique numeric
identifier. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |

#### `globalOperations.delete()`

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.operation` | `string` | Yes | Name of the Operations resource to delete, or its unique numeric
identifier. |

project.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation

with an error code. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |

### `regionInstanceGroupManagers`

#### `regionInstanceGroupManagers.update()`

Updates a managed instance group using the information that you specify
in the request.
This operation is marked as DONE when the group is updated
even if the instances in the group have not yet been updated. You must
separately verify the status of the individual instances with thelistmanagedinstances
method.

If you update your group to specify a new template or instance
configuration, it's possible that your intended specification for each VM
in the group is different from the current state of that VM. To learn how
to apply an updated configuration to the VMs in a MIG, seeUpdating instances in
a MIG.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.instanceGroupManager` | `string` | Yes | The name of the instance group manager. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `regionInstanceGroupManagers.setAutoHealingPolicies()`

Modifies the autohealing policy for the instances in this managed
instance group.
[Deprecated] This method is deprecated. UseregionInstanceGroupManagers.patch instead.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.instanceGroupManager` | `string` | Yes | Name of the managed instance group. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `regionInstanceGroupManagers.deleteInstances()`

Flags the specified instances in the managed instance group to be
immediately deleted. The instances are also removed from any target
pools of which they were a member. This method reduces thetargetSize of the managed instance group by the number of
instances that you delete.
The deleteInstances operation is marked DONE if
the deleteInstances request is successful. The underlying
actions take additional time. You must separately verify the status of thedeleting action with thelistmanagedinstances
method.

If the group is part of a backend
service that has enabled
connection draining, it can take up to 60 seconds after the connection
draining duration has elapsed before the VM instance is removed or deleted.

You can specify a maximum of 1000 instances with this method per request.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.instanceGroupManager` | `string` | Yes | Name of the managed instance group. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `regionInstanceGroupManagers.setTargetPools()`

Modifies the target pools to which all new instances in this group are
assigned. Existing instances in the group are not affected.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.instanceGroupManager` | `string` | Yes | Name of the managed instance group. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `regionInstanceGroupManagers.listErrors()`

Lists all errors thrown by actions on instances for a given regional
managed instance group. The filter andorderBy query parameters are not supported.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request.
This should conform to RFC1035. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.instanceGroupManager` | `string` | Yes | The name of the managed instance group.
It must be a string that meets the requirements in RFC1035, or an
unsigned long integer: must match regexp pattern:
(?:[a-z](?:[-a-z0-9]{0,61}[a-z0-9])?)|1-9{0,19}. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |

#### `regionInstanceGroupManagers.listManagedInstances()`

Lists the instances in the managed instance group and instances that are
scheduled to be created. The list includes any current actions
that the group has scheduled for its instances. The orderBy
query parameter is not supported.   The `pageToken` query parameter is
supported only if the group's `listManagedInstancesResults` field is set
to `PAGINATED`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.instanceGroupManager` | `string` | Yes | The name of the managed instance group. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a

| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |

#### `regionInstanceGroupManagers.setInstanceTemplate()`

#### `regionInstanceGroupManagers.recreateInstances()`

Flags the specified VM instances in the managed instance group to be
immediately recreated. Each instance is recreated using the group's current
configuration. This operation is marked as DONE when the flag
is set even if the instances have not yet been recreated. You must
separately verify the status of each instance by checking itscurrentAction field; for more information, see Checking
the status of managed instances.

If the group is part of a backend
service that has enabled
connection draining, it can take up to 60 seconds after the connection
draining duration has elapsed before the VM instance is removed or deleted.

You can specify a maximum of 1000 instances with this method per request.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|

| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |

#### `regionInstanceGroupManagers.abandonInstances()`

Flags the specified instances to be immediately removed from the managed
instance group. Abandoning an instance does not delete the
instance, but it does remove the instance from any target pools that are
applied by the managed instance group. This method reduces thetargetSize of the managed instance group by the
number of instances that you abandon. This operation is marked asDONE when the action is scheduled even if the instances have
not yet been removed from the group. You must separately verify the
status of the abandoning action with thelistmanagedinstances
method.

If the group is part of a backend
service that has enabled
connection draining, it can take up to 60 seconds after the connection
draining duration has elapsed before the VM instance is removed or deleted.

resumed. This method increases thetargetSize and decreases the targetSuspendedSize
of the managed instance group by the number of instances that you resume.
The resumeInstances operation is marked DONE if
the resumeInstances request is successful. The underlying
actions take additional time. You must separately verify the status of theRESUMING action with thelistmanagedinstances
method.

In this request, you can only specify instances that are suspended. For
example, if an instance was previously suspended using the suspendInstances
method, it can be resumed using the resumeInstances method.

If a health check is attached to the managed instance group, the specified
instances will be verified as healthy after they are resumed.

You can specify a maximum of 1000 instances with this method per request.

| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `regionInstanceGroupManagers.resize()`

Changes the intended size of the managed instance group. If you increase
the size, the group creates new instances using the current instance
template. If you decrease the size, the group deletes one or more
instances.

The resize operation is marked DONE if theresize request is successful. The underlying actions take
additional time. You must separately verify the status of thecreating or deleting actions with thelistmanagedinstances
method.

If the group is part of a backend
service that has enabled
connection draining, it can take up to 60 seconds after the connection
draining duration has elapsed before the VM instance is removed or deleted.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request. |

#### `regionInstanceGroupManagers.updatePerInstanceConfigs()`

Inserts or updates per-instance configurations for the managed instance
group. perInstanceConfig.name serves as a key used to
distinguish whether to perform insert or patch.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

#### `regionInstanceGroupManagers.stopInstances()`

Flags the specified instances in the managed instance group to be
immediately stopped. You can only specify instances that are running in
this request. This method reduces thetargetSize and increases the targetStoppedSize
of the managed instance group by the number of instances that you stop.
The stopInstances operation is marked DONE if
the stopInstances request is successful. The underlying
actions take additional time. You must separately verify the status of theSTOPPING action with thelistmanagedinstances
method.

If the standbyPolicy.initialDelaySec field is set, the group
delays stopping the instances until initialDelaySec have
passed from instance.creationTimestamp (that is, when the
instance was created). This delay gives your application time to
set itself up and initialize on the instance. If more thaninitialDelaySec seconds have passed sinceinstance.creationTimestamp when this method is called, there
will be zero delay.

If the group is part of a backend
service that has enabled
connection draining, it can take up to 60 seconds after the connection
draining duration has elapsed before the VM instance is stopped.

Stopped instances can be started using the startInstances
method.

You can specify a maximum of 1000 instances with this method per request.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |

request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.instanceGroupManager` | `string` | Yes | The name of the managed instance group.
It should conform to RFC1035. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `regionInstanceGroupManagers.createInstances()`

Creates instances with per-instance configurations in this regional managed
instance group. Instances are created using the current instance template.
The create instances operation is marked DONE if
the createInstances request is successful. The underlying
actions take additional time. You must separately verify the status of thecreating or actions with the listmanagedinstances
method.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.instanceGroupManager` | `string` | Yes | The name of the managed instance group.
It should conform to RFC1035. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | The name of theregion
where the managed instance group is located.
It should conform to RFC1035. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `regionInstanceGroupManagers.suspendInstances()`

Flags the specified instances in the managed instance group to be
immediately suspended. You can only specify instances that are running in
this request. This method reduces thetargetSize and increases the targetSuspendedSize
of the managed instance group by the number of instances that you suspend.
The suspendInstances operation is marked DONE if
the suspendInstances request is successful. The underlying
actions take additional time. You must separately verify the status of theSUSPENDING action with thelistmanagedinstances
method.

If the standbyPolicy.initialDelaySec field is set, the group
delays suspension of the instances until initialDelaySec have
passed from instance.creationTimestamp (that is, when the
instance was created). This delay gives your application time to
set itself up and initialize on the instance. If more thaninitialDelaySec seconds have passed sinceinstance.creationTimestamp when this method is called, there
will be zero delay.

If the group is part of a backend
service that has enabled
connection draining, it can take up to 60 seconds after the connection
draining duration has elapsed before the VM instance is suspended.

Suspended instances can be resumed using the resumeInstances
method.

You can specify a maximum of 1000 instances with this method per request.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.instanceGroupManager` | `string` | Yes | Name of the managed instance group. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `regionInstanceGroupManagers.list()`

Retrieves the list of managed instance groups that are contained
within the specified region.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |

#### `regionInstanceGroupManagers.startInstances()`

Flags the specified instances in the managed instance group to be
started. This method increases thetargetSize and decreases the targetStoppedSize
of the managed instance group by the number of instances that you start.
The startInstances operation is marked DONE if
the startInstances request is successful. The underlying
actions take additional time. You must separately verify the status of theSTARTING action with thelistmanagedinstances
method.

In this request, you can only specify instances that are stopped. For
example, if an instance was previously stopped using the stopInstances
method, it can be started using the startInstances method.

If a health check is attached to the managed instance group, the specified
instances will be verified as healthy after they are started.

You can specify a maximum of 1000 instances with this method per request.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request. |
| `params.instanceGroupManager` | `string` | Yes | Name of the managed instance group. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `regionInstanceGroupManagers.insert()`

Creates a managed instance group using the information that you specify
in the request. After the group is created, instances in the group are
created using the specified instance template.
This operation is marked as DONE when the group is created
even if the instances in the group have not yet been created. You must
separately verify the status of the individual instances with thelistmanagedinstances
method.

A regional managed instance group can contain up to 2000 instances.

#### `regionInstanceGroupManagers.resizeAdvanced()`

Resizes the regional managed instance group with advanced configuration
options like disabling creation retries. This is an extended version of theresize method.

If you increase the size, the group creates new instances using the current
instance template. If you decrease the size, the group deletes one or more
instances.

The resize operation is marked DONE if theresize request is successful. The underlying actions take
additional time. You must separately verify the status of thecreating or deleting actions with the get
orlistmanagedinstances
method.

If the group is part of a backend
service that has enabled
connection draining, it can take up to 60 seconds after the connection
draining duration has elapsed before the VM instance is removed or deleted.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |

in the request.
This operation is marked as DONE when the group is patched
even if the instances in the group are still in the process of being
patched. You must separately verify the status of the individual instances
with the listmanagedinstances
method. This method supportsPATCH
semantics and uses theJSON merge
patch format and processing rules.

If you update your group to specify a new template or instance
configuration, it's possible that your intended specification for each VM
in the group is different from the current state of that VM. To learn how
to apply an updated configuration to the VMs in a MIG, seeUpdating instances in
a MIG.

### `regionCompositeHealthChecks`

#### `regionCompositeHealthChecks.aggregatedList()`

Retrieves the list of all CompositeHealthCheck resources (all
regional) available to the specified project.

To prevent failure, it is recommended that you set the
`returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which
aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Name of the project scoping this request. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |

#### `regionCompositeHealthChecks.list()`

(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

### `regionZones`

#### `regionZones.list()`

Retrieves the list of Zone resources under the specific region available to
the specified project.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Region for this request. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |

### `globalAddresses`

#### `globalAddresses.get()`

Returns the specified address resource.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.address` | `string` | Yes | Name of the address resource to return. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |

Resources documentation.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.resource` | `string` | Yes | Name or id of the resource for this request. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `globalAddresses.insert()`

Creates an address resource in the specified project by using the data
included in the request.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `regionNetworkFirewallPolicies.list()`

Lists all the network firewall policies that have been configured

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |

request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

#### `disks.list()`

Retrieves a list of persistent disks contained within
the specified zone.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of the zone for this request. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |

#### `disks.delete()`

Deletes the specified persistent disk. Deleting a disk removes its data
permanently and is irreversible. However, deleting a disk does not
delete any snapshots
previously made from the disk. You must separatelydelete
snapshots.

|---|---|---|---|
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of the zone for this request. |
| `params.disk` | `string` | Yes | Name of the persistent disk to delete. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |

#### `disks.insert()`

Creates a persistent disk in the specified project using the data
in the request. You can create a disk from a source
(sourceImage, sourceSnapshot, orsourceDisk) or create an empty 500 GB data disk by
omitting all properties. You can also create a disk that is larger than
the default size by specifying the sizeGb property.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.sourceImage` | `string` | No | Source image to restore onto a disk. This field is optional. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of the zone for this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `disks.aggregatedList()`

Retrieves an aggregated list of persistent disks.

To prevent failure, it is recommended that you set the
`returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which
aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |

that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an

must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.serviceProject` | `string` | No | The project id or project number in which the subnetwork is intended to be
used. Only applied for Shared VPC. See [Shared VPC
documentation](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/shared-vpc/) |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |

#### `subnetworks.setIamPolicy()`

Sets the access control policy on the specified resource.
Replaces any existing policy.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | The name of the region for this request. |
| `params.resource` | `string` | Yes | Name or id of the resource for this request. |

#### `subnetworks.list()`

Retrieves a list of subnetworks available to the specified
project.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.

| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.views` | `string` | No | Defines the extra views returned back in the subnetwork resource.
Supported values:
   
   - WITH_UTILIZATION: Utilization data is included in the
   response. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in

| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |

#### `subnetworks.aggregatedList()`

Retrieves an aggregated list of subnetworks.

To prevent failure, Google recommends that you set the
`returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts

aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:

| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:

These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:

For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |

#### `networks.list()`

Retrieves the list of networks available to the specified project.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |

#### `networks.addPeering()`

For more information, readViewing
referrers to VM instances.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of the zone for this request. |
| `params.instance` | `string` | Yes | Name of the target instance scoping this request, or '-' if the
request should span over all instances in the container. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |

#### `instances.startWithEncryptionKey()`

the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This

#### `instances.suspend()`

This method suspends a running instance, saving its state to persistent
storage, and allows you to resume the instance at a later time. Suspended
instances have no compute costs (cores or RAM), and incur only storage
charges for the saved VM memory and localSSD data. Any charged resources
the virtual machine was using, such as persistent disks and static IP
addresses, will continue to be charged while the instance is suspended.
For more information, see
Suspending and resuming an instance.

#### `instances.list()`

Retrieves the list of instances contained within
the specified zone.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of the zone for this request. |
| `params.view` | `string` | No | View of the instance. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |

#### `instances.detachDisk()`

Detaches a disk from an instance.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.deviceName` | `string` | Yes | The device name of the disk to detach. Make a get() request on
the instance to view currently attached disks and device names. |
| `params.instance` | `string` | Yes | Instance name for this request. |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of the zone for this request. |

#### `instances.aggregatedList()`

Retrieves an aggregated list of all of the instances in your project
across all regions and zones.

The performance of this method degrades when a filter is specified on a
project that has a very large number of instances.

To prevent failure, Google recommends that you set the
`returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most

| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which
aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |

timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |

| `params.start` | `string` | No | Specifies the starting byte position of the output to return. To start with
the first byte of output to the specified port, omit this field or set it
to `0`.

If the output for that byte position is available, this field matches the
`start` parameter sent with the request. If the amount of serial console
output exceeds the size of the buffer (1 MB), the oldest output is
discarded and is no longer available. If the requested start position
refers to discarded output, the start position is adjusted to the oldest
output still available, and the adjusted start position is returned as the
`start` property value.

You can also provide a negative start position, which translates to the
most recent number of bytes written to the serial port. For example, -3 is
interpreted as the most recent 3 bytes written to the serial console. Note
that the negative start is bounded by the retained buffer size, and the
returned serial console output will not exceed the max buffer size. |

that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |

| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | The name of the region for this request. |

#### `regionInstanceTemplates.list()`

Retrieves a list of instance templates that are contained within the
specified project and region.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.view` | `string` | No | View of the instance template. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | The name of the regions for this request. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |

Lists the HealthSources for a project in the given region.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,

include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case

| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:

`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular

| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |

#### `projects.get()`

Returns the specified Project resource.

To decrease latency for this method, you can optionally omit any unneeded
information from the response by using a field mask. This practice is
especially recommended for unused quota information (the `quotas` field).
To exclude one or more fields, set your request's `fields` query parameter
to only include the fields you need. For example, to only include the `id`
and `selfLink` fields, add the query parameter `?fields=id,selfLink` to
your request.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |

#### `projects.listXpnHosts()`

Lists all shared VPC host projects visible to the user in an organization.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `projects.setCommonInstanceMetadata()`

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an

`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.instanceGroup` | `string` | Yes | Name of the regional instance group for which we want to list the
instances. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `regionInstanceGroups.list()`

Retrieves the list of instance group resources contained within
the specified region.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |

timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get

aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get

labels, read the Labeling
Resources documentation.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |

#### `globalOrganizationOperations.delete()`

Deletes the specified Operations resource.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.parentId` | `string` | No | Parent ID for this request. |
| `params.operation` | `string` | Yes | Name of the Operations resource to delete, or its unique numeric
identifier. |

### `regionOperations`

#### `regionOperations.list()`

Retrieves a list of Operation resources contained within
the specified region.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region for this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |

#### `regionOperations.delete()`

Deletes the specified region-specific Operations resource.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.operation` | `string` | Yes | Name of the Operations resource to delete, or its unique numeric
identifier. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region for this request. |

#### `regionOperations.wait()`

Waits for the specified Operation resource to return as `DONE`
or for the request to approach the 2 minute deadline, and retrieves the
specified Operation resource. This method differs from the
`GET` method in that it waits for no more than the default
deadline (2 minutes) and then returns the current state of the operation,
which might be `DONE` or still in progress.

This method is called on a best-effort basis. Specifically:
   
   
    - In uncommon cases, when the server is overloaded, the request might
    return before the default deadline is reached, or might return after zero
    seconds.
   - If the default deadline is reached, there is no guarantee that the
    operation is actually done when the method returns. Be prepared to retry
    if the operation is not `DONE`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |

| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region for this request. |

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which
aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |

#### `firewallPolicies.list()`

Lists all the policies that have been configured for the specified
folder or organization.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.parentId` | `string` | No | Parent ID for this request. The ID can be either be "folders/[FOLDER_ID]"
if the parent is a folder or "organizations/[ORGANIZATION_ID]" if the
parent is an organization. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |

#### `firewallPolicies.addPacketMirroringRule()`

### `regions`

#### `regions.list()`

Retrieves the list of region resources available to the specified project.

To decrease latency for this method, you can optionally omit any unneeded
information from the response by using a field mask. This practice is
especially recommended for unused quota information
(the `items.quotas` field).
To exclude one or more fields, set your request's `fields` query parameter
to only include the fields you need. For example, to only include the `id`
and `selfLink` fields, add the query parameter `?fields=id,selfLink` to
your request.

This method fails if the quota information is unavailable for the region
and if the organization policy constraint
compute.requireBasicQuotaInResponse is enforced. This
constraint, when enforced, disables the fail-open behaviour when quota
information (the `items.quotas` field) is unavailable for the region.
It is recommended to use the default setting
for the constraint unless your application requires the fail-closed
behaviour for this method.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |

#### `machineImages.setIamPolicy()`

Sets the access control policy on the specified resource.
Replaces any existing policy.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.resource` | `string` | Yes | Name or id of the resource for this request. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

### `instanceTemplates`

#### `instanceTemplates.setIamPolicy()`

Sets the access control policy on the specified resource.
Replaces any existing policy.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.resource` | `string` | Yes | Name or id of the resource for this request. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `instanceTemplates.list()`

Retrieves a list of instance templates that are contained within
the specified project.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.view` | `string` | No | View of the instance template. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |

#### `instanceTemplates.insert()`

Creates an instance template in the specified project using the
data that is included in the request. If you are creating a new template to
update an existing instance group, your new instance template must use the
same network or, if applicable, the same subnetwork as the original
template.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `instanceTemplates.get()`

Returns the specified instance template.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.view` | `string` | No | View of the instance template. |

| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |

#### `instanceTemplates.delete()`

Deletes the specified instance template. Deleting an instance template is
permanent and cannot be undone. It is not possible to delete templates
that are already in use by a managed instance group.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.instanceTemplate` | `string` | Yes | The name of the instance template to delete. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be

(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |

#### `instanceTemplates.aggregatedList()`

Retrieves the list of all InstanceTemplates resources, regional and global,
available to the specified project.

To prevent failure, Google recommends that you set the
`returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:

labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering

```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular

| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Name of the project scoping this request. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which
aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |

#### `regionSecurityPolicies.list()`

List all the policies that have been configured for the specified project

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |

#### `regionSecurityPolicies.patch()`

Patches the specified policy with the data included in the request. To
clear fields in the policy, leave the fields empty and specify them in the
updateMask. This cannot be used to be update the rules in the policy.
Please use the per rule methods like addRule, patchRule, and removeRule
instead.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |

### `futureReservations`

#### `futureReservations.list()`

A list of all the future reservations that have been configured for the
specified project in specified zone.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | Name of the zone for this request. Name should conform to RFC1035. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.healthAggregationPolicy` | `string` | Yes | Name of the HealthAggregationPolicy to update. The name
must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `regionHealthAggregationPolicies.get()`

Returns the specified HealthAggregationPolicy resource in the given region.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.healthAggregationPolicy` | `string` | Yes | Name of the HealthAggregationPolicy resource to return. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |

### `crossSiteNetworks`

#### `crossSiteNetworks.get()`

Returns the specified cross-site network in the given scope.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.crossSiteNetwork` | `string` | Yes | Name of the cross-site network to return. |

#### `crossSiteNetworks.list()`

Lists the cross-site networks for a project in the given scope.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |

#### `crossSiteNetworks.patch()`

Updates the specified cross-site network with the data included in
the request. This method supportsPATCH
semantics and uses theJSON merge
patch format and processing rules.

| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

|---|---|---|---|
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request. |
| `params.targetPool` | `string` | Yes | Name of the TargetPool resource to which the security policy should be
set. The name should conform to RFC1035. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `targetPools.testIamPermissions()`

Returns permissions that a caller has on the specified resource.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.resource` | `string` | Yes | Name or id of the resource for this request. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | The name of the region for this request. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `targetPools.aggregatedList()`

Retrieves an aggregated list of target pools.

To prevent failure, Google recommends that you set the
`returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which
aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |

#### `targetPools.removeHealthCheck()`

Removes health check URL from a target pool.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region for this request. |
| `params.targetPool` | `string` | Yes | Name of the target pool to remove health checks from. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `targetPools.setBackup()`

#### `nodeGroups.addNodes()`

Adds specified number of nodes to the node group.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |

| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

### `instanceGroups`

#### `instanceGroups.get()`

Returns the specified zonal instance group. Get a list of available zonal
instance groups by making a list() request.

For managed instance groups, use theinstanceGroupManagers

where the instance group is located. |
| `params.instanceGroup` | `string` | Yes | The name of the instance group where you are adding instances. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `instanceGroups.list()`

Retrieves the list of zonal instance group resources contained within the
specified zone.

For managed instance groups, use theinstanceGroupManagers
or regionInstanceGroupManagers
methods instead.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of thezone
where the instance group is located. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |

| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which
aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |

| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |

| `params.nodeTemplate` | `string` | Yes | Name of the node template to return. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | The name of the region for this request. |

#### `nodeTemplates.aggregatedList()`

Retrieves an aggregated list of node templates.

To prevent failure, Google recommends that you set the
`returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which
aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |

#### `nodeTemplates.testIamPermissions()`

#### `nodeTemplates.list()`

Retrieves a list of node templates available to the specified
project.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results

| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `firewalls.list()`

Retrieves the list of firewall rules available to the specified
project.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |

#### `firewalls.delete()`

Deletes the specified firewall.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |

#### `globalNetworkEndpointGroups.insert()`

The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Name of the project scoping this request. |

`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are

#### `instanceGroupManagerResizeRequests.list()`

Retrieves a list of resize requests that are contained in the
managed instance group.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of thezone where the managed
instance group is located. The name should conform to RFC1035. |
| `params.instanceGroupManager` | `string` | Yes | The name of the managed instance group. The name should conform to RFC1035. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |

the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which
aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |

#### `backendBuckets.delete()`

Deletes the specified BackendBucket resource.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |

#### `serviceAttachments.aggregatedList()`

Retrieves the list of all ServiceAttachment resources,
regional and global, available to the specified project.

To prevent failure, Google recommends that you set the
`returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which
aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Name of the project scoping this request. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |

expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |

#### `regionAutoscalers.update()`

| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within

(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region for this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |

Name should conform to RFC1035. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |

| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |

exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.destinationPrefix` | `string` | No | Limit results to destinations that are subnets of this CIDR range |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.addressFamily` | `string` | No | (Required) limit results to this address family (either IPv4 or IPv6) |
| `params.routeType` | `string` | No | (Required) limit results to this type of route (either LEARNED or
ADVERTISED) |
| `params.router` | `string` | Yes | Name or id of the resource for this request.
Name should conform to RFC1035. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region for this request. |

#### `routers.aggregatedList()`

Retrieves an aggregated list of routers.

To prevent failure, Google recommends that you set the
`returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which
aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |

in the request.
This operation is marked as DONE when the group is patched
even if the instances in the group are still in the process of being
patched. You must separately verify the status of the individual instances
with thelistManagedInstances
method. This method supportsPATCH
semantics and uses theJSON merge
patch format and processing rules.

If you update your group to specify a new template or instance
configuration, it's possible that your intended specification for each VM
in the group is different from the current state of that VM. To learn how
to apply an updated configuration to the VMs in a MIG, seeUpdating instances in
a MIG.

#### `instanceGroupManagers.startInstances()`

Flags the specified instances in the managed instance group to be
started. This method increases thetargetSize and decreases the targetStoppedSize
of the managed instance group by the number of instances that you start.
The startInstances operation is marked DONE if
the startInstances request is successful. The underlying
actions take additional time. You must separately verify the status of theSTARTING action with thelistmanagedinstances
method.

In this request, you can only specify instances that are stopped. For
example, if an instance was previously stopped using the stopInstances
method, it can be started using the startInstances method.

If a health check is attached to the managed instance group, the specified
instances will be verified as healthy after they are started.

You can specify a maximum of 1000 instances with this method per request.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |

#### `instanceGroupManagers.aggregatedList()`

Retrieves the list of managed instance groups and groups them by zone.

To prevent failure, Google recommends that you set the
`returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which
aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |

#### `instanceGroupManagers.suspendInstances()`

Flags the specified instances in the managed instance group to be
immediately suspended. You can only specify instances that are running in
this request. This method reduces thetargetSize and increases the targetSuspendedSize
of the managed instance group by the number of instances that you suspend.
The suspendInstances operation is marked DONE if
the suspendInstances request is successful. The underlying
actions take additional time. You must separately verify the status of theSUSPENDING action with thelistmanagedinstances
method.

If the standbyPolicy.initialDelaySec field is set, the group
delays suspension of the instances until initialDelaySec have
passed from instance.creationTimestamp (that is, when the
instance was created). This delay gives your application time to
set itself up and initialize on the instance. If more thaninitialDelaySec seconds have passed sinceinstance.creationTimestamp when this method is called, there
will be zero delay.

If the group is part of a backend
service that has enabled
connection draining, it can take up to 60 seconds after the connection
draining duration has elapsed before the VM instance is suspended.

Suspended instances can be resumed using the resumeInstances
method.

You can specify a maximum of 1000 instances with this method per request.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.instanceGroupManager` | `string` | Yes | The name of the managed instance group. |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of thezone where the managed
instance group is located. |

that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `instanceGroupManagers.setTargetPools()`

Modifies the target pools to which all instances in this managed instance
group are assigned. The target pools automatically apply to all of the
instances in the managed instance group. This operation is markedDONE when you make the request even if the instances have not
yet been added to their target pools. The change might take some time to
apply to all of the instances in the group depending on the size of the
group.

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.instanceGroupManager` | `string` | Yes | The name of the managed instance group. It should conform to RFC1035. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |

#### `instanceGroupManagers.listManagedInstances()`

Lists all of the instances in the managed instance group. Each instance
in the list has a currentAction, which indicates the action
that the managed instance group is performing on the instance. For example,
if the group is still creating an instance, the currentAction
is CREATING. If a previous action failed, the
list displays the errors for that failed action. The orderBy
query parameter is not supported. The `pageToken` query parameter is
supported only if the group's `listManagedInstancesResults` field is set
to `PAGINATED`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of thezone where the managed
instance group is located. |
| `params.instanceGroupManager` | `string` | Yes | The name of the managed instance group. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |

#### `instanceGroupManagers.stopInstances()`

Flags the specified instances in the managed instance group to be
immediately stopped. You can only specify instances that are running in
this request. This method reduces thetargetSize and increases the targetStoppedSize
of the managed instance group by the number of instances that you stop.
The stopInstances operation is marked DONE if
the stopInstances request is successful. The underlying
actions take additional time. You must separately verify the status of theSTOPPING action with thelistmanagedinstances
method.

If the standbyPolicy.initialDelaySec field is set, the group
delays stopping the instances until initialDelaySec have
passed from instance.creationTimestamp (that is, when the
instance was created). This delay gives your application time to
set itself up and initialize on the instance. If more thaninitialDelaySec seconds have passed sinceinstance.creationTimestamp when this method is called, there
will be zero delay.

If the group is part of a backend
service that has enabled
connection draining, it can take up to 60 seconds after the connection
draining duration has elapsed before the VM instance is stopped.

Stopped instances can be started using the startInstances
method.

You can specify a maximum of 1000 instances with this method per request.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.instanceGroupManager` | `string` | Yes | The name of the managed instance group. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of thezone where the managed
instance group is located. |

| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `instanceGroupManagers.updatePerInstanceConfigs()`

Inserts or updates per-instance configurations for the managed instance
group. perInstanceConfig.name serves as a key used to
distinguish whether to perform insert or patch.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|

It should conform to RFC1035. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |

| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `instanceGroupManagers.listErrors()`

Lists all errors thrown by actions on instances for a given managed
instance group. The filter and orderBy query
parameters are not supported.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |

resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |

#### `instanceGroupManagers.resize()`

Resizes the managed instance group. If you increase the size, the group
creates new instances using the current instance template. If you decrease
the size, the group deletes instances. The resize operation is markedDONE when the resize actions are scheduled even if the group
has not yet added or deleted any instances. You must separately
verify the status of the creating or deleting
actions with thelistmanagedinstances
method.

When resizing down, the instance group arbitrarily chooses the order in
which VMs are deleted. The group takes into account some VM attributes when
making the selection including:

+ The status of the VM instance.
+ The health of the VM instance.
+ The instance template version the VM is based on.
+ For regional managed instance groups, the location of the VM instance.

This list is subject to change.

If the group is part of a backend
service that has enabled
connection draining, it can take up to 60 seconds after the connection
draining duration has elapsed before the VM instance is removed or deleted.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.instanceGroupManager` | `string` | Yes | The name of the managed instance group. |
| `params.size` | `integer` | Yes | The number of running instances that the managed instance group should
maintain at any given time. The group automatically adds or removes
instances to maintain the number of instances specified by this parameter. |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of thezone where the managed
instance group is located. |

#### `instanceGroupManagers.abandonInstances()`

Flags the specified instances to be removed from the
managed instance group. Abandoning an instance does not delete the
instance, but it does remove the instance from any target pools that are
applied by the managed instance group. This method reduces thetargetSize of the managed instance group by the
number of instances that you abandon. This operation is marked asDONE when the action is scheduled even if the instances have
not yet been removed from the group. You must separately verify the
status of the abandoning action with thelistmanagedinstances
method.

If the group is part of a backend
service that has enabled
connection draining, it can take up to 60 seconds after the connection
draining duration has elapsed before the VM instance is removed or deleted.

You can specify a maximum of 1000 instances with this method per request.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|

#### `instanceGroupManagers.recreateInstances()`

Flags the specified VM instances in the managed instance group to be
immediately recreated. Each instance is recreated using the group's current
configuration. This operation is marked as DONE when the flag
is set even if the instances have not yet been recreated. You must
separately verify the status of each instance by checking itscurrentAction field; for more information, see Checking
the status of managed instances.

If the group is part of a backend
service that has enabled
connection draining, it can take up to 60 seconds after the connection
draining duration has elapsed before the VM instance is removed or deleted.

| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `instanceGroupManagers.insert()`

Creates a managed instance group using the information that you specify
in the request. After the group is created, instances in the group are
created using the specified instance template.
This operation is marked as DONE when the group is created
even if the instances in the group have not yet been created. You
must separately verify the status of the individual instances with thelistmanagedinstances
method.

A managed instance group can have up to 1000 VM instances per group. Please
contact Cloud Support if you need an increase in
this limit.

#### `instanceGroupManagers.deleteInstances()`

Flags the specified instances in the managed instance group for immediate
deletion. The instances are also removed from any target
pools of which they were a member. This method reduces thetargetSize of the managed instance group by the number of
instances that you delete. This operation is marked as DONE
when the action is scheduled even if the instances are still being deleted.
You must separately verify the status of the deleting action
with thelistmanagedinstances
method.

If the group is part of a backend

#### `instanceGroupManagers.resizeAdvanced()`

Resizes the managed instance group with advanced configuration options like
disabling creation retries. This is an extended version of theresize method.

If you increase the size of the instance group, the group creates new
instances using the current instance template. If you decrease the size,
the group deletes instances. The resize operation is markedDONE when the resize actions are scheduled even if the group
has not yet added or deleted any instances. You must separately
verify the status of the creating,creatingWithoutRetries, or deleting actions with
the get
orlistmanagedinstances
method.

If the group is part of a backend

| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `securityPolicies.addRule()`

Inserts a rule into a security policy.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.securityPolicy` | `string` | Yes | Name of the security policy to update. |
| `params.validateOnly` | `boolean` | No | If true, the request will not be committed. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |

| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `securityPolicies.aggregatedList()`

Retrieves the list of all SecurityPolicy resources, regional and global,
available to the specified project.

To prevent failure, Google recommends that you set the
`returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which
aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Name of the project scoping this request. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |

#### `securityPolicies.list()`

List all the policies that have been configured for the specified project.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.

the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.targetHttpProxy` | `string` | Yes | Name of the TargetHttpProxy resource to delete. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |

#### `targetHttpProxies.testIamPermissions()`

Returns permissions that a caller has on the specified resource.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.resource` | `string` | Yes | Name or id of the resource for this request. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `targetHttpProxies.aggregatedList()`

Retrieves the list of all TargetHttpProxy resources, regional and global,
available to the specified project.

To prevent failure, Google recommends that you set the
`returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which
aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Name of the project scoping this request. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |

must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.packetMirroring` | `string` | Yes | Name of the PacketMirroring resource to patch. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region for this request. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `packetMirrorings.list()`

Retrieves a list of PacketMirroring resources available to the specified
project and region.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region for this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |

of update-mask. Only the following fields can be modified:
pool_provisioned_capacity_gb, pool_provisioned_iops and
pool_provisioned_throughput.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.updateMask` | `string` | No | update_mask indicates fields to be updated as part of this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the

storagePool does not delete any snapshots previously
made from the storagePool. You must separately delete
snapshots.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the

types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular

| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which
aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get

Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |

#### `storagePoolTypes.get()`

Returns the specified storage pool type.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|

deprecated. For more information on image families, seePublic
image families documentation.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.family` | `string` | Yes | Name of the image family to search for. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | The image project that the image belongs to. For example, to get a CentOS
image, specify centos-cloud as the image project. |

#### `images.get()`

Returns the specified image.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.image` | `string` | Yes | Name of the image resource to return. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |

|---|---|---|---|
| `params.forceCreate` | `boolean` | No | Force image creation if true. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |

Only the following fields can be modified: family, description,
deprecation status.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

#### `images.list()`

Retrieves the list of custom images
available to the specified project. Custom images are images you
create that belong to your project. This method does not
get any images that belong to other projects, including publicly-available
images, like Debian 8. If you want to get a list of publicly-available
images, use this method to make a request to the respective image project,
such as debian-cloud or windows-cloud.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`

`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.zone` | `string` | No | The zone query parameter. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region,
global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added
after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always
include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource
types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only
scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found
will be included. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation

aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`

The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get

| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region for this request. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get

reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |

#### `regionDisks.addResourcePolicies()`

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |

#### `publicAdvertisedPrefixes.list()`

Lists the PublicAdvertisedPrefixes for a project.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and
the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This
prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.resource` | `string` | Yes | Name or id of the resource for this request. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | The region for this request. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `regionSnapshots.getIamPolicy()`

Gets the access control policy for a resource. May be empty if no such
policy or resource exists.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.optionsRequestedPolicyVersion` | `integer` | No | Requested IAM Policy version. |
| `params.resource` | `string` | Yes | Name or id of the resource for this request. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | The name of the region for this request. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |

#### `regionSnapshots.insert()`

Creates a snapshot in the specified region using the data included
in the request.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so
that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the
request if it has already been completed.

the request times out. If you make the request again with the same
request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same
request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This

The request ID must be
a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region for this request. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `regionSnapshots.setIamPolicy()`

Sets the access control policy on the specified resource.
Replaces any existing policy.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | The name of the region for this request. |
| `params.resource` | `string` | Yes | Name or id of the resource for this request. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `regionSnapshots.list()`

Retrieves the list of Snapshot resources contained within
the specified region.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most
Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
API improvement proposal AIP-160.
These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an
operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator
must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can
exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying
`name != example-instance`.

The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined.
For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use:
```
labels.owner:*
```

You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify
`scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only
if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering
on nested fields to filter based onresource labels.

To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
parentheses. For example:
```
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake")
```
By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you
can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly.
For example:
```
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
(cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND
(scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
```

If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne`
(not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or
without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples:

`fieldname eq unquoted literal`
`fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'`
`fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
`(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")`

The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using GoogleRE2 library syntax.
The literal value must match the entire field.

For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance",
you would use `name ne .*instance`.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular
expressions. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results
are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation
timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts
results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in
reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort
resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.

Currently, only sorting by `name` or
`creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region for this request. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
`nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get
the next page of results. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.
If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`,
Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get
the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are
`0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |

#### `regionSnapshots.get()`

Returns the specified Snapshot resource.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.snapshot` | `string` | Yes | Name of the Snapshot resource to return. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region for this request. |

### `interconnectLocations`

#### `interconnectLocations.list()`

Retrieves the list of interconnect locations available to the specified
project.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case
of failure. The default value is false.

For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a
single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources,
with an error code. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
