## API Reference

### `globalOperations`

#### `globalOperations.list()`

Retrieves a list of Operation resources contained within the specified project.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular expressions. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false. For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources, with an error code. |

#### `globalOperations.aggregatedList()`

Retrieves an aggregated list of all operations. To prevent failure, Google recommends that you set the `returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular expressions. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region, global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found will be included. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false. For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources, with an error code. |
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |

#### `globalOperations.get()`

Retrieves the specified Operations resource.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.operation` | `string` | Yes | Name of the Operations resource to return, or its unique numeric identifier. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |

#### `globalOperations.wait()`

Waits for the specified Operation resource to return as `DONE` or for the request to approach the 2 minute deadline, and retrieves the specified Operation resource. This method differs from the `GET` method in that it waits for no more than the default deadline (2 minutes) and then returns the current state of the operation, which might be `DONE` or still in progress. This method is called on a best-effort basis. Specifically: - In uncommon cases, when the server is overloaded, the request might return before the default deadline is reached, or might return after zero seconds. - If the default deadline is reached, there is no guarantee that the operation is actually done when the method returns. Be prepared to retry if the operation is not `DONE`.

For new resource types added after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found will be included. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false. For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources, with an error code. |
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |

#### `acceleratorTypes.get()`

### `globalAddresses`

#### `globalAddresses.list()`

Retrieves a list of global addresses.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular expressions. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false. For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources, with an error code. |

| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |

### `snapshots`

#### `snapshots.list()`

Retrieves the list of Snapshot resources contained within the specified project.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular expressions. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false. For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources, with an error code. |

#### `snapshots.aggregatedList()`

Retrieves an aggregated list of all of the snapshots in your project across all regions and global scope. To prevent failure, Google recommends that you set the `returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160.

The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular expressions. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region, global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found will be included. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false. For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources, with an error code. |
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |

| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region, global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found will be included. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false. For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources, with an error code. |
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |

### `regionDisks`

#### `regionDisks.list()`

Retrieves the list of persistent disks contained within the specified region.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular expressions. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region for this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false.

### `firewalls`

#### `firewalls.list()`

Retrieves the list of firewall rules available to the specified project.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular expressions. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false. For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources, with an error code. |

### `networkFirewallPolicies`

#### `networkFirewallPolicies.list()`

Lists all the policies that have been configured for the specified project.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular expressions. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false. For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources, with an error code. |

If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region, global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found will be included. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false. For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources, with an error code. |
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |

### `regionNetworkFirewallPolicies`

#### `regionNetworkFirewallPolicies.list()`

Lists all the network firewall policies that have been configured for the specified project in the given region.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular expressions. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false.

#### `securityPolicies.listPreconfiguredExpressionSets()`

Gets the current list of preconfigured Web Application Firewall (WAF) expressions.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular expressions. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false. For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources, with an error code. |

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular expressions. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region, global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found will be included. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests.

If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.securityPolicy` | `string` | Yes | Name of the security policy to update. |

| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `organizationSecurityPolicies.listPreconfiguredExpressionSets()`

Gets the current list of preconfigured Web Application Firewall (WAF) expressions.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular expressions. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results. |
| `params.parentId` | `string` | No | Parent ID for this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false. For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources, with an error code. |

### `instances`

#### `instances.list()`

Retrieves the list of instances contained within the specified zone.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular expressions. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests.

#### `instances.aggregatedList()`

Retrieves an aggregated list of all of the instances in your project across all regions and zones. The performance of this method degrades when a filter is specified on a project that has a very large number of instances. To prevent failure, Google recommends that you set the `returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160.

The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular expressions. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region, global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found will be included. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.

#### `instances.suspend()`

This method suspends a running instance, saving its state to persistent storage, and allows you to resume the instance at a later time. Suspended instances have no compute costs (cores or RAM), and incur only storage charges for the saved VM memory and localSSD data. Any charged resources the virtual machine was using, such as persistent disks and static IP addresses, will continue to be charged while the instance is suspended. For more information, see Suspending and resuming an instance.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |

### `reservations`

#### `reservations.list()`

A list of all the reservations that have been configured for the specified project in specified zone.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular expressions. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false. For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources, with an error code. |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | Name of the zone for this request. |

#### `reservations.aggregatedList()`

Retrieves an aggregated list of reservations. To prevent failure, Google recommends that you set the `returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160.

The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular expressions. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region, global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found will be included. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false. For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources, with an error code. |
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |

#### `reservations.get()`

|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests.

### `instanceGroups`

#### `instanceGroups.list()`

Retrieves the list of zonal instance group resources contained within the specified zone. For managed instance groups, use the instanceGroupManagers or regionInstanceGroupManagers methods instead.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular expressions. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false. For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources, with an error code. |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of the zone where the instance group is located. |

#### `instanceGroups.aggregatedList()`

Retrieves the list of instance groups and sorts them by zone. To prevent failure, Google recommends that you set the `returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160.

The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular expressions. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region, global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found will be included. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false. For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources, with an error code. |
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |

#### `instanceGroups.get()`

The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular expressions. |
| `params.instanceGroup` | `string` | Yes | Name of the regional instance group for which we want to list the instances. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false. For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources, with an error code. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `regionInstanceGroups.setNamedPorts()`

Sets the named ports for the specified regional instance group.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.instanceGroup` | `string` | Yes | The name of the regional instance group where the named ports are updated. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean.

| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of the zone where the managed instance group is located. |

#### `instanceGroupManagers.aggregatedList()`

Retrieves the list of managed instance groups and groups them by zone. To prevent failure, Google recommends that you set the `returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular expressions. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region, global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found will be included. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.

| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of the zone where the managed instance group is located. |

#### `instanceGroupManagers.insert()`

Creates a managed instance group using the information that you specify in the request. After the group is created, instances in the group are created using the specified instance template. This operation is marked as DONE when the group is created even if the instances in the group have not yet been created. You must separately verify the status of the individual instances with the listmanagedinstances method. A managed instance group can have up to 1000 VM instances per group. Please contact Cloud Support if you need an increase in this limit.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of the zone where you want to create the managed instance group. |

#### `instanceGroupManagers.update()`

Updates a managed instance group using the information that you specify in the request. This operation is marked as DONE when the group is updated even if the instances in the group have not yet been updated. You must separately verify the status of the individual instances with the listManagedInstances method. If you update your group to specify a new template or instance configuration, it's possible that your intended specification for each VM in the group is different from the current state of that VM. To learn how to apply an updated configuration to the VMs in a MIG, see Updating instances in a MIG.

| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of the zone where you want to create the managed instance group. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `instanceGroupManagers.patch()`

Updates a managed instance group using the information that you specify in the request. This operation is marked as DONE when the group is patched even if the instances in the group are still in the process of being patched. You must separately verify the status of the individual instances with the listManagedInstances method. This method supports PATCH semantics and uses the JSON merge patch format and processing rules. If you update your group to specify a new template or instance configuration, it's possible that your intended specification for each VM in the group is different from the current state of that VM. To learn how to apply an updated configuration to the VMs in a MIG, see Updating instances in a MIG.

| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `instanceGroupManagers.delete()`

Deletes the specified managed instance group and all of the instances in that group. Note that the instance group must not belong to a backend service. Read Deleting an instance group for more information.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.instanceGroupManager` | `string` | Yes | The name of the managed instance group to delete. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.

| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of the zone where the managed instance group is located. |

#### `instanceGroupManagers.deleteInstances()`

Flags the specified instances in the managed instance group for immediate deletion. The instances are also removed from any target pools of which they were a member. This method reduces the targetSize of the managed instance group by the number of instances that you delete. This operation is marked as DONE when the action is scheduled even if the instances are still being deleted. You must separately verify the status of the deleting action with the listmanagedinstances method. If the group is part of a backend service that has enabled connection draining, it can take up to 60 seconds after the connection draining duration has elapsed before the VM instance is removed or deleted. You can specify a maximum of 1000 instances with this method per request.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.instanceGroupManager` | `string` | Yes | The name of the managed instance group. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.

| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `instanceGroupManagers.suspendInstances()`

Flags the specified instances in the managed instance group to be immediately suspended. You can only specify instances that are running in this request. This method reduces the targetSize and increases the targetSuspendedSize of the managed instance group by the number of instances that you suspend. The suspendInstances operation is marked DONE if the suspendInstances request is successful. The underlying actions take additional time. You must separately verify the status of the SUSPENDING action with the listmanagedinstances method. If the standbyPolicy.initialDelaySec field is set, the group delays suspension of the instances until initialDelaySec have passed from instance.creationTimestamp (that is, when the instance was created). This delay gives your application time to set itself up and initialize on the instance. If more than initialDelaySec seconds have passed since instance.creationTimestamp when this method is called, there will be zero delay. If the group is part of a backend service that has enabled connection draining, it can take up to 60 seconds after the connection draining duration has elapsed before the VM instance is suspended. Suspended instances can be resumed using the resumeInstances method. You can specify a maximum of 1000 instances with this method per request.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.instanceGroupManager` | `string` | Yes | The name of the managed instance group. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of the zone where the managed instance group is located. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `instanceGroupManagers.resumeInstances()`

Flags the specified instances in the managed instance group to be resumed. This method increases the targetSize and decreases the targetSuspendedSize of the managed instance group by the number of instances that you resume. The resumeInstances operation is marked DONE if the resumeInstances request is successful. The underlying actions take additional time. You must separately verify the status of the RESUMING action with the listmanagedinstances method. In this request, you can only specify instances that are suspended. For example, if an instance was previously suspended using the suspendInstances method, it can be resumed using the resumeInstances method. If a health check is attached to the managed instance group, the specified instances will be verified as healthy after they are resumed. You can specify a maximum of 1000 instances with this method per request.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.instanceGroupManager` | `string` | Yes | The name of the managed instance group. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of the zone where the managed instance group is located. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `instanceGroupManagers.stopInstances()`

Flags the specified instances in the managed instance group to be immediately stopped. You can only specify instances that are running in this request. This method reduces the targetSize and increases the targetStoppedSize of the managed instance group by the number of instances that you stop. The stopInstances operation is marked DONE if the stopInstances request is successful. The underlying actions take additional time. You must separately verify the status of the STOPPING action with the listmanagedinstances method. If the standbyPolicy.initialDelaySec field is set, the group delays stopping the instances until initialDelaySec have passed from instance.creationTimestamp (that is, when the instance was created). This delay gives your application time to set itself up and initialize on the instance. If more than initialDelaySec seconds have passed since instance.creationTimestamp when this method is called, there will be zero delay. If the group is part of a backend service that has enabled connection draining, it can take up to 60 seconds after the connection draining duration has elapsed before the VM instance is stopped. Stopped instances can be started using the startInstances method. You can specify a maximum of 1000 instances with this method per request.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.instanceGroupManager` | `string` | Yes | The name of the managed instance group. |

This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of the zone where the managed instance group is located. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `instanceGroupManagers.startInstances()`

Flags the specified instances in the managed instance group to be started. This method increases the targetSize and decreases the targetStoppedSize of the managed instance group by the number of instances that you start. The startInstances operation is marked DONE if the startInstances request is successful. The underlying actions take additional time. You must separately verify the status of the STARTING action with the listmanagedinstances method. In this request, you can only specify instances that are stopped. For example, if an instance was previously stopped using the stopInstances method, it can be started using the startInstances method. If a health check is attached to the managed instance group, the specified instances will be verified as healthy after they are started. You can specify a maximum of 1000 instances with this method per request.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|

| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of the zone where the managed instance group is located. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `instanceGroupManagers.abandonInstances()`

Flags the specified instances to be removed from the managed instance group. Abandoning an instance does not delete the instance, but it does remove the instance from any target pools that are applied by the managed instance group. This method reduces the targetSize of the managed instance group by the number of instances that you abandon. This operation is marked as DONE when the action is scheduled even if the instances have not yet been removed from the group. You must separately verify the status of the abandoning action with the listmanagedinstances method. If the group is part of a backend service that has enabled connection draining, it can take up to 60 seconds after the connection draining duration has elapsed before the VM instance is removed or deleted. You can specify a maximum of 1000 instances with this method per request.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |

The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of the zone where the managed instance group is located. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `instanceGroupManagers.recreateInstances()`

Flags the specified VM instances in the managed instance group to be immediately recreated. Each instance is recreated using the group's current configuration. This operation is marked as DONE when the flag is set even if the instances have not yet been recreated. You must separately verify the status of each instance by checking its currentAction field; for more information, see Checking the status of managed instances. If the group is part of a backend service that has enabled connection draining, it can take up to 60 seconds after the connection draining duration has elapsed before the VM instance is removed or deleted. You can specify a maximum of 1000 instances with this method per request.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.instanceGroupManager` | `string` | Yes | The name of the managed instance group. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of the zone where the managed instance group is located. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `instanceGroupManagers.resize()`

Resizes the managed instance group. If you increase the size, the group creates new instances using the current instance template. If you decrease the size, the group deletes instances. The resize operation is marked DONE when the resize actions are scheduled even if the group has not yet added or deleted any instances. You must separately verify the status of the creating or deleting actions with the listmanagedinstances method. When resizing down, the instance group arbitrarily chooses the order in which VMs are deleted. The group takes into account some VM attributes when making the selection including: + The status of the VM instance. + The health of the VM instance. + The instance template version the VM is based on. + For regional managed instance groups, the location of the VM instance. This list is subject to change. If the group is part of a backend service that has enabled connection draining, it can take up to 60 seconds after the connection draining duration has elapsed before the VM instance is removed or deleted.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.instanceGroupManager` | `string` | Yes | The name of the managed instance group. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.size` | `integer` | Yes | The number of running instances that the managed instance group should maintain at any given time. The group automatically adds or removes instances to maintain the number of instances specified by this parameter. |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of the zone where the managed instance group is located. |

#### `instanceGroupManagers.resizeAdvanced()`

Resizes the managed instance group with advanced configuration options like disabling creation retries. This is an extended version of the resize method. If you increase the size of the instance group, the group creates new instances using the current instance template. If you decrease the size, the group deletes instances. The resize operation is marked DONE when the resize actions are scheduled even if the group has not yet added or deleted any instances. You must separately verify the status of the creating, creatingWithoutRetries, or deleting actions with the get or listmanagedinstances method. If the group is part of a backend service that has enabled connection draining, it can take up to 60 seconds after the connection draining duration has elapsed before the VM instance is removed or deleted.

#### `instanceGroupManagers.listManagedInstances()`

Lists all of the instances in the managed instance group. Each instance in the list has a currentAction, which indicates the action that the managed instance group is performing on the instance. For example, if the group is still creating an instance, the currentAction is CREATING. If a previous action failed, the list displays the errors for that failed action. The orderBy query parameter is not supported. The `pageToken` query parameter is supported only if the group's `listManagedInstancesResults` field is set to `PAGINATED`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular expressions. |
| `params.instanceGroupManager` | `string` | Yes | The name of the managed instance group. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false. For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources, with an error code. |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of the zone where the managed instance group is located. |

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular expressions. |
| `params.instanceGroupManager` | `string` | Yes | The name of the managed instance group. It must be a string that meets the requirements in RFC1035, or an unsigned long integer: must match regexp pattern: (?:[a-z](?:[-a-z0-9]{0,61}[a-z0-9])?)|1-9{0,19}. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest result first).

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular expressions. |
| `params.instanceGroupManager` | `string` | Yes | The name of the managed instance group. The name should conform to RFC1035. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false. For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources, with an error code. |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of the zone where the managed instance group is located. The name should conform to RFC1035. |

#### `instanceGroupManagerResizeRequests.cancel()`

Cancels the specified resize request and removes it from the queue. Cancelled resize request does no longer wait for the resources to be provisioned. Cancel is only possible for requests that are accepted in the queue.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.instanceGroupManager` | `string` | Yes | The name of the managed instance group. The name should conform to RFC1035 or be a resource ID. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.resizeRequest` | `string` | Yes | The name of the resize request to cancel. The name should conform to RFC1035 or be a resource ID. |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of the zone where the managed instance group is located. The name should conform to RFC1035. |

#### `instanceGroupManagerResizeRequests.delete()`

Deletes the specified, inactive resize request. Requests that are still active cannot be deleted. Deleting request does not delete instances that were provisioned previously.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.instanceGroupManager` | `string` | Yes | The name of the managed instance group. The name should conform to RFC1035 or be a resource ID. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.resizeRequest` | `string` | Yes | The name of the resize request to delete. The name should conform to RFC1035 or be a resource ID. |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of the zone where the managed instance group is located. The name should conform to RFC1035. |

### `regionInstanceGroupManagers`

#### `regionInstanceGroupManagers.list()`

Retrieves the list of managed instance groups that are contained within the specified region.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields.

| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request. |

#### `regionInstanceGroupManagers.insert()`

Creates a managed instance group using the information that you specify in the request. After the group is created, instances in the group are created using the specified instance template. This operation is marked as DONE when the group is created even if the instances in the group have not yet been created. You must separately verify the status of the individual instances with the listmanagedinstances method. A regional managed instance group can contain up to 2000 instances.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `regionInstanceGroupManagers.update()`

Updates a managed instance group using the information that you specify in the request. This operation is marked as DONE when the group is updated even if the instances in the group have not yet been updated. You must separately verify the status of the individual instances with the listmanagedinstances method. If you update your group to specify a new template or instance configuration, it's possible that your intended specification for each VM in the group is different from the current state of that VM. To learn how to apply an updated configuration to the VMs in a MIG, see Updating instances in a MIG.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `regionInstanceGroupManagers.patch()`

Updates a managed instance group using the information that you specify in the request. This operation is marked as DONE when the group is patched even if the instances in the group are still in the process of being patched. You must separately verify the status of the individual instances with the listmanagedinstances method. This method supports PATCH semantics and uses the JSON merge patch format and processing rules. If you update your group to specify a new template or instance configuration, it's possible that your intended specification for each VM in the group is different from the current state of that VM. To learn how to apply an updated configuration to the VMs in a MIG, see Updating instances in a MIG.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.instanceGroupManager` | `string` | Yes | The name of the instance group manager. |

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `regionInstanceGroupManagers.delete()`

Deletes the specified managed instance group and all of the instances in that group.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.instanceGroupManager` | `string` | Yes | Name of the managed instance group to delete. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.

The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |

#### `regionInstanceGroupManagers.deleteInstances()`

Flags the specified instances in the managed instance group to be immediately deleted. The instances are also removed from any target pools of which they were a member. This method reduces the targetSize of the managed instance group by the number of instances that you delete. The deleteInstances operation is marked DONE if the deleteInstances request is successful. The underlying actions take additional time. You must separately verify the status of the deleting action with the listmanagedinstances method. If the group is part of a backend service that has enabled connection draining, it can take up to 60 seconds after the connection draining duration has elapsed before the VM instance is removed or deleted. You can specify a maximum of 1000 instances with this method per request.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.instanceGroupManager` | `string` | Yes | Name of the managed instance group. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `regionInstanceGroupManagers.suspendInstances()`

Flags the specified instances in the managed instance group to be immediately suspended. You can only specify instances that are running in this request. This method reduces the targetSize and increases the targetSuspendedSize of the managed instance group by the number of instances that you suspend. The suspendInstances operation is marked DONE if the suspendInstances request is successful. The underlying actions take additional time. You must separately verify the status of the SUSPENDING action with the listmanagedinstances method. If the standbyPolicy.initialDelaySec field is set, the group delays suspension of the instances until initialDelaySec have passed from instance.creationTimestamp (that is, when the instance was created). This delay gives your application time to set itself up and initialize on the instance. If more than initialDelaySec seconds have passed since instance.creationTimestamp when this method is called, there will be zero delay. If the group is part of a backend service that has enabled connection draining, it can take up to 60 seconds after the connection draining duration has elapsed before the VM instance is suspended. Suspended instances can be resumed using the resumeInstances method. You can specify a maximum of 1000 instances with this method per request.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.instanceGroupManager` | `string` | Yes | Name of the managed instance group. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |

Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `regionInstanceGroupManagers.resumeInstances()`

Flags the specified instances in the managed instance group to be resumed. This method increases the targetSize and decreases the targetSuspendedSize of the managed instance group by the number of instances that you resume. The resumeInstances operation is marked DONE if the resumeInstances request is successful. The underlying actions take additional time. You must separately verify the status of the RESUMING action with the listmanagedinstances method. In this request, you can only specify instances that are suspended. For example, if an instance was previously suspended using the suspendInstances method, it can be resumed using the resumeInstances method. If a health check is attached to the managed instance group, the specified instances will be verified as healthy after they are resumed. You can specify a maximum of 1000 instances with this method per request.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.instanceGroupManager` | `string` | Yes | Name of the managed instance group. |

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `regionInstanceGroupManagers.stopInstances()`

Flags the specified instances in the managed instance group to be immediately stopped. You can only specify instances that are running in this request. This method reduces the targetSize and increases the targetStoppedSize of the managed instance group by the number of instances that you stop. The stopInstances operation is marked DONE if the stopInstances request is successful. The underlying actions take additional time. You must separately verify the status of the STOPPING action with the listmanagedinstances method. If the standbyPolicy.initialDelaySec field is set, the group delays stopping the instances until initialDelaySec have passed from instance.creationTimestamp (that is, when the instance was created). This delay gives your application time to set itself up and initialize on the instance. If more than initialDelaySec seconds have passed since instance.creationTimestamp when this method is called, there will be zero delay. If the group is part of a backend service that has enabled connection draining, it can take up to 60 seconds after the connection draining duration has elapsed before the VM instance is stopped. Stopped instances can be started using the startInstances method. You can specify a maximum of 1000 instances with this method per request.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.instanceGroupManager` | `string` | Yes | The name of the managed instance group. |

If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `regionInstanceGroupManagers.startInstances()`

Flags the specified instances in the managed instance group to be started. This method increases the targetSize and decreases the targetStoppedSize of the managed instance group by the number of instances that you start. The startInstances operation is marked DONE if the startInstances request is successful. The underlying actions take additional time. You must separately verify the status of the STARTING action with the listmanagedinstances method. In this request, you can only specify instances that are stopped. For example, if an instance was previously stopped using the stopInstances method, it can be started using the startInstances method. If a health check is attached to the managed instance group, the specified instances will be verified as healthy after they are started. You can specify a maximum of 1000 instances with this method per request.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|

The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `regionInstanceGroupManagers.abandonInstances()`

Flags the specified instances to be immediately removed from the managed instance group. Abandoning an instance does not delete the instance, but it does remove the instance from any target pools that are applied by the managed instance group. This method reduces the targetSize of the managed instance group by the number of instances that you abandon. This operation is marked as DONE when the action is scheduled even if the instances have not yet been removed from the group. You must separately verify the status of the abandoning action with the listmanagedinstances method. If the group is part of a backend service that has enabled connection draining, it can take up to 60 seconds after the connection draining duration has elapsed before the VM instance is removed or deleted. You can specify a maximum of 1000 instances with this method per request.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.instanceGroupManager` | `string` | Yes | Name of the managed instance group. |

If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `regionInstanceGroupManagers.recreateInstances()`

Flags the specified VM instances in the managed instance group to be immediately recreated. Each instance is recreated using the group's current configuration. This operation is marked as DONE when the flag is set even if the instances have not yet been recreated. You must separately verify the status of each instance by checking its currentAction field; for more information, see Checking the status of managed instances. If the group is part of a backend service that has enabled connection draining, it can take up to 60 seconds after the connection draining duration has elapsed before the VM instance is removed or deleted. You can specify a maximum of 1000 instances with this method per request.

| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `regionInstanceGroupManagers.resize()`

Changes the intended size of the managed instance group. If you increase the size, the group creates new instances using the current instance template. If you decrease the size, the group deletes one or more instances. The resize operation is marked DONE if the resize request is successful. The underlying actions take additional time. You must separately verify the status of the creating or deleting actions with the listmanagedinstances method. If the group is part of a backend service that has enabled connection draining, it can take up to 60 seconds after the connection draining duration has elapsed before the VM instance is removed or deleted.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |

| `params.size` | `integer` | Yes | Number of instances that should exist in this instance group manager. |

#### `regionInstanceGroupManagers.resizeAdvanced()`

Resizes the regional managed instance group with advanced configuration options like disabling creation retries. This is an extended version of the resize method. If you increase the size, the group creates new instances using the current instance template. If you decrease the size, the group deletes one or more instances. The resize operation is marked DONE if the resize request is successful. The underlying actions take additional time. You must separately verify the status of the creating or deleting actions with the get or listmanagedinstances method. If the group is part of a backend service that has enabled connection draining, it can take up to 60 seconds after the connection draining duration has elapsed before the VM instance is removed or deleted.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.instanceGroupManager` | `string` | Yes | The name of the managed instance group. It must be a string that meets the requirements in RFC1035. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request. It must be a string that meets the requirements in RFC1035. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `regionInstanceGroupManagers.listManagedInstances()`

Lists the instances in the managed instance group and instances that are scheduled to be created. The list includes any current actions that the group has scheduled for its instances. The orderBy query parameter is not supported. The `pageToken` query parameter is supported only if the group's `listManagedInstancesResults` field is set to `PAGINATED`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular expressions. |
| `params.instanceGroupManager` | `string` | Yes | The name of the managed instance group. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false. For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources, with an error code. |

#### `regionInstanceGroupManagers.listErrors()`

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular expressions. |
| `params.instanceGroupManager` | `string` | Yes | The name of the managed instance group. It must be a string that meets the requirements in RFC1035, or an unsigned long integer: must match regexp pattern: (?:[a-z](?:[-a-z0-9]{0,61}[a-z0-9])?)|1-9{0,19}. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

#### `regionInstanceGroupManagerResizeRequests.list()`

Retrieves a list of Resize Requests that are contained in the managed instance group.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular expressions. |
| `params.instanceGroupManager` | `string` | Yes | The name of the managed instance group. The name should conform to RFC1035. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |

#### `regionInstanceGroupManagerResizeRequests.delete()`

Deletes the specified, inactive resize request. Requests that are still active cannot be deleted. Deleting request does not delete instances that were provisioned previously.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.instanceGroupManager` | `string` | Yes | The name of the managed instance group. Name should conform to RFC1035 or be a resource ID. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | The name of the region scoping this request. Name should conform to RFC1035. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.resizeRequest` | `string` | Yes | The name of the resize request to delete. Name should conform to RFC1035 or be a resource ID. |

### `autoscalers`

#### `autoscalers.list()`

Retrieves a list of autoscalers contained within the specified zone.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular expressions. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false. For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources, with an error code. |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | Name of the zone for this request. |

#### `autoscalers.aggregatedList()`

Retrieves an aggregated list of autoscalers. To prevent failure, Google recommends that you set the `returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160.

The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular expressions. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region, global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found will be included. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false. For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources, with an error code. |
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |

### `backendServices`

#### `backendServices.list()`

Retrieves the list of BackendService resources available to the specified project.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular expressions. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false. For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources, with an error code. |

#### `backendServices.aggregatedList()`

Retrieves the list of all BackendService resources, regional and global, available to the specified project. To prevent failure, Google recommends that you set the `returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160.

The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular expressions. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region, global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found will be included. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Name of the project scoping this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false. For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources, with an error code. |
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |

### `regionBackendServices`

#### `regionBackendServices.list()`

Retrieves the list of regional BackendService resources available to the specified project in the given region.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular expressions. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false. For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources, with an error code. |

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular expressions. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region, global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always include every visible scope for each scope type in response.

### `crossSiteNetworks`

#### `crossSiteNetworks.list()`

Lists the cross-site networks for a project in the given scope.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular expressions. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false. For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources, with an error code. |

#### `crossSiteNetworks.get()`

Returns the specified cross-site network in the given scope.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.crossSiteNetwork` | `string` | Yes | Name of the cross-site network to return. |

### `interconnectAttachmentGroups`

#### `interconnectAttachmentGroups.list()`

Lists the InterconnectAttachmentGroups for a project in the given scope.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular expressions. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false. For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources, with an error code. |

#### `externalVpnGateways.list()`

Retrieves the list of ExternalVpnGateway available to the specified project.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular expressions. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false. For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources, with an error code. |

#### `futureReservations.list()`

A list of all the future reservations that have been configured for the specified project in specified zone.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular expressions. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false. For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources, with an error code. |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | Name of the zone for this request. Name should conform to RFC1035. |

#### `futureReservations.aggregatedList()`

Retrieves an aggregated list of future reservations. To prevent failure, Google recommends that you set the `returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160.

The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular expressions. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region, global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found will be included. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false. For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources, with an error code. |
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |

| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields.

Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular expressions. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |

### `regionHealthChecks`

#### `regionHealthChecks.list()`

Retrieves the list of HealthCheck resources available to the specified project.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular expressions. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false. For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources, with an error code. |

This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `httpsHealthChecks.patch()`

Updates a HttpsHealthCheck resource in the specified project using the data included in the request. This method supports PATCH semantics and uses the JSON merge patch format and processing rules.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.httpsHealthCheck` | `string` | Yes | Name of the HttpsHealthCheck resource to patch. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |

| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

### `instanceTemplates`

#### `instanceTemplates.list()`

Retrieves a list of instance templates that are contained within the specified project.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular expressions. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false. For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources, with an error code. |
| `params.view` | `string` | No | View of the instance template. |

#### `instanceTemplates.get()`

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `instanceTemplates.delete()`

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.instanceTemplate` | `string` | Yes | The name of the instance template to delete. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests.

Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular expressions. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region, global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found will be included. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests.

#### `instantSnapshots.aggregatedList()`

Retrieves an aggregated list of instantSnapshots. To prevent failure, Google recommends that you set the `returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular expressions. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region, global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found will be included. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false. For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources, with an error code. |
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.resource` | `string` | Yes | Name or id of the resource for this request. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

### `machineImages`

#### `machineImages.list()`

Retrieves a list of machine images that are contained within the specified project.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular expressions. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false. For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources, with an error code. |

#### `machineImages.get()`

Returns the specified machine image.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.machineImage` | `string` | Yes | The name of the machine image. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |

#### `machineImages.insert()`

Creates a machine image in the specified project using the data that is included in the request. If you are creating a new machine image to update an existing instance, your new machine image should use the same network or, if applicable, the same subnetwork as the original instance.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular expressions. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular expressions. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region, global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found will be included. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Name of the project scoping this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false. For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources, with an error code. |
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |

| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false. For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources, with an error code. |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of the zone where the network endpoint group is located. It should comply with RFC1035. |

### `globalNetworkEndpointGroups`

#### `globalNetworkEndpointGroups.list()`

Retrieves the list of network endpoint groups that are located in the specified project.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular expressions. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false. For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources, with an error code. |

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.direction` | `string` | No | The direction of the exchanged routes. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular expressions. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.network` | `string` | Yes | Name of the network for this request. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results. |
| `params.peeringName` | `string` | No | The response will show routes exchanged over the given peering connection. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.region` | `string` | No | The region of the request. The response will include all subnet routes, static routes and dynamic routes in the region. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false. For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources, with an error code. |

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160.

Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular expressions. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular expressions. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region, global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found will be included. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests.

### `nodeTemplates`

#### `nodeTemplates.list()`

Retrieves a list of node templates available to the specified project.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular expressions. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | The name of the region for this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false. For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources, with an error code. |

#### `nodeTemplates.aggregatedList()`

Retrieves an aggregated list of node templates. To prevent failure, Google recommends that you set the `returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular expressions. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region, global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found will be included. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests.

#### `packetMirrorings.list()`

Retrieves a list of PacketMirroring resources available to the specified project and region.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular expressions. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region for this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false. For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources, with an error code. |

#### `packetMirrorings.aggregatedList()`

Retrieves an aggregated list of packetMirrorings. To prevent failure, Google recommends that you set the `returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160.

The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular expressions. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region, global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found will be included. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false. For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources, with an error code. |
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |

### `projects`

#### `projects.get()`

Returns the specified Project resource. To decrease latency for this method, you can optionally omit any unneeded information from the response by using a field mask. This practice is especially recommended for unused quota information (the `quotas` field). To exclude one or more fields, set your request's `fields` query parameter to only include the fields you need. For example, to only include the `id` and `selfLink` fields, add the query parameter `?fields=id,selfLink` to your request.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |

Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false. For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources, with an error code. |

#### `projects.setDefaultNetworkTier()`

Sets the default network tier of the project. The default network tier is used when an address/forwardingRule/instance is created without specifying the network tier field.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

### `publicAdvertisedPrefixes`

#### `publicAdvertisedPrefixes.list()`

Lists the PublicAdvertisedPrefixes for a project.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular expressions. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results. |

Lists all PublicDelegatedPrefix resources owned by the specific project across all scopes. To prevent failure, Google recommends that you set the `returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular expressions. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region, global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found will be included. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Name of the project scoping this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false. For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources, with an error code. |
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |

### `regions`

#### `regions.list()`

Retrieves the list of region resources available to the specified project. To decrease latency for this method, you can optionally omit any unneeded information from the response by using a field mask. This practice is especially recommended for unused quota information (the `items.quotas` field). To exclude one or more fields, set your request's `fields` query parameter to only include the fields you need. For example, to only include the `id` and `selfLink` fields, add the query parameter `?fields=id,selfLink` to your request. This method fails if the quota information is unavailable for the region and if the organization policy constraint compute.requireBasicQuotaInResponse is enforced. This constraint, when enforced, disables the fail-open behaviour when quota information (the `items.quotas` field) is unavailable for the region. It is recommended to use the default setting for the constraint unless your application requires the fail-closed behaviour for this method.

Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne .*instance`.

| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false. For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources, with an error code. |

#### `regions.get()`

Returns the specified Region resource. To decrease latency for this method, you can optionally omit any unneeded information from the response by using a field mask. This practice is especially recommended for unused quota information (the `quotas` field).

|---|---|---|---|
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request.

The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular expressions. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false. For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources, with an error code. |

| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`.

If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |

### `routes`

#### `routes.list()`

Retrieves the list of Route resources available to the specified project.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular expressions. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false. For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources, with an error code. |

The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.router` | `string` | Yes | Name of the Router resource where Route Policy is defined. |

#### `routers.getRoutePolicy()`

#### `routers.listRoutePolicies()`

Retrieves a list of router route policy subresources available to the specified project.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular expressions. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results. |

| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region for this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false. For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources, with an error code. |

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields.

However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular expressions. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.sslCertificate` | `string` | Yes | Name of the SslCertificate resource to delete. |

#### `sslCertificates.aggregatedList()`

Retrieves the list of all SslCertificate resources, regional and global, available to the specified project. To prevent failure, Google recommends that you set the `returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular expressions. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region, global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found will be included. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Name of the project scoping this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false. For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources, with an error code. |
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |

#### `regionSslPolicies.listAvailableFeatures()`

Lists all features that can be specified in the SSL policy when using custom profile.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular expressions. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region scoping this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false. For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources, with an error code. |

| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region, global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found will be included. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned.

Lists the disks in a specified storage pool.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular expressions. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false. For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources, with an error code. |
| `params.storagePool` | `string` | Yes | Name of the storage pool to list disks of. |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | The name of the zone for this request. |

| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |

### `targetHttpsProxies`

#### `targetHttpsProxies.list()`

Retrieves the list of TargetHttpsProxy resources available to the specified project.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular expressions. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false. For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources, with an error code. |

#### `targetHttpsProxies.aggregatedList()`

Retrieves the list of all TargetHttpsProxy resources, regional and global, available to the specified project. To prevent failure, Google recommends that you set the `returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160.

The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular expressions. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region, global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found will be included. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |

| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Name of the project scoping this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false. For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources, with an error code. |
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |

For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular expressions. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false. For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources, with an error code. |
| `params.zone` | `string` | Yes | Name of the zone scoping this request. |

#### `targetInstances.aggregatedList()`

Retrieves an aggregated list of target instances. To prevent failure, Google recommends that you set the `returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields.

The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular expressions. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region, global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found will be included. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.

| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false. For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources, with an error code. |
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |

The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular expressions. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false.

### `targetTcpProxies`

#### `targetTcpProxies.list()`

Retrieves the list of TargetTcpProxy resources available to the specified project.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular expressions. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false. For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources, with an error code. |

#### `targetTcpProxies.aggregatedList()`

Retrieves the list of all TargetTcpProxy resources, regional and global, available to the specified project. To prevent failure, Google recommends that you set the `returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular expressions. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region, global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found will be included. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests.

| `params.targetTcpProxy` | `string` | Yes | Name of the TargetTcpProxy resource to delete. |

#### `regionTargetTcpProxies.testIamPermissions()`

Returns permissions that a caller has on the specified resource.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | The name of the region for this request. |
| `params.resource` | `string` | Yes | Name or id of the resource for this request. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

### `targetVpnGateways`

#### `targetVpnGateways.list()`

Retrieves a list of target VPN gateways available to the specified project and region.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular expressions. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region for this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false. For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources, with an error code. |

#### `targetVpnGateways.aggregatedList()`

Retrieves an aggregated list of target VPN gateways. To prevent failure, Google recommends that you set the `returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.

You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular expressions. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region, global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found will be included. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests.

### `vpnGateways`

#### `vpnGateways.list()`

Retrieves a list of VPN gateways available to the specified project and region.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular expressions. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.region` | `string` | Yes | Name of the region for this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false. For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources, with an error code. |

#### `vpnGateways.aggregatedList()`

Retrieves an aggregated list of VPN gateways. To prevent failure, Google recommends that you set the `returnPartialSuccess` parameter to `true`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160.

Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular expressions. |
| `params.includeAllScopes` | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region, global) should be included in the response. For new resource types added after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always include every visible scope for each scope type in response. For resource types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found will be included. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests.

| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false. For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources, with an error code. |
| `params.serviceProjectNumber` | `string` | No | The Shared VPC service project id or service project number for which aggregated list request is invoked for subnetworks list-usable api. |

For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne .*instance`. You cannot combine constraints on multiple fields using regular expressions. |
| `params.maxResults` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`) |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or `creationTimestamp desc` is supported. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results. |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides partial results in case of failure. The default value is false. For example, when partial success behavior is enabled, aggregatedList for a single zone scope either returns all resources in the zone or no resources, with an error code. |

#### `wireGroups.get()`

Gets the specified wire group resource in the given scope.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.crossSiteNetwork` | `string` | Yes |  |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.wireGroup` | `string` | Yes | Name of the wire group resource to return. |

#### `wireGroups.insert()`

Creates a wire group in the specified project in the given scope using the parameters that are included in the request.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.crossSiteNetwork` | `string` | Yes |  |
| `params.project` | `string` | Yes | Project ID for this request. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). end_interface: MixerMutationRequestBuilder |
| `params.validateOnly` | `boolean` | No | [Input Only] Validate the new configuration, but don't create it. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `wireGroups.delete()`

Deletes the specified wire group in the given scope.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |

### `zones`

#### `zones.list()`

Retrieves the list of Zone resources available to the specified project.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow API improvement proposal AIP-160. These two types of filter expressions cannot be mixed in one request. If you want to use AIP-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=` or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions.
