This call updates the proposal_state from `PROPOSED` to `BUYER_ACCEPTED`, or from `SELLER_ACCEPTED` to `FINALIZED`. Upon calling this endpoint, the buyer implicitly agrees to the terms and conditions optionally set within the proposal by the publisher.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.accountId` | `string` | Yes | Account ID of the buyer. |
| `params.proposalId` | `string` | Yes | The ID of the proposal to accept. |

#### `accounts.proposals.completeSetup()`

You can opt-in to manually update proposals to indicate that setup is complete. By default, proposal setup is automatically completed after their deals are finalized. Contact your Technical Account Manager to opt in. Buyers can call this method when the proposal has been finalized, and all the required creatives have been uploaded using the Creatives API. This call updates the `is_setup_completed` field on the deals in the proposal, and notifies the seller. The server then advances the revision number of the most recent proposal. To mark an individual deal as ready to serve, call `buyers.finalizedDeals.setReadyToServe` in the Marketplace API.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.accountId` | `string` | Yes | Account ID of the buyer. |

Note that if the `has_seller_paused` bit is also set, serving will not resume until the seller also resumes. It is a no-op to resume an already-running proposal. It is an error to call ResumeProposal for a proposal that is not finalized or renegotiating.
