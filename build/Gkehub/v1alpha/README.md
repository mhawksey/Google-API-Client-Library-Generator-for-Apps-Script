## API Reference

### `projects`

### `projects.locations`

#### `projects.locations.list()`

Lists information about the supported locations for this service.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.name` | `string` | Yes | The resource that owns the locations collection, if applicable. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter to narrow down results to a preferred subset. The filtering language accepts strings like `"displayName=tokyo"`, and is documented in more detail in [AIP-160](https://google.aip.dev/160). |
| `params.pageSize` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results to return. If not set, the service selects a default. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | A page token received from the `next_page_token` field in the response. Send that page token to receive the subsequent page. |
| `params.extraLocationTypes` | `string` | No | Optional. Unless explicitly documented otherwise, don't use this unsupported field which is primarily intended for internal usage. |

#### `projects.locations.get()`

Gets information about a location.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.name` | `string` | Yes | Resource name for the location. |

### `projects.locations.operations`

#### `projects.locations.operations.list()`

Lists operations that match the specified filter in the request. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns `UNIMPLEMENTED`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.name` | `string` | Yes | The name of the operation's parent resource. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | The standard list filter. |
| `params.pageSize` | `integer` | No | The standard list page size. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | The standard list page token. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | When set to `true`, operations that are reachable are returned as normal, and those that are unreachable are returned in the [ListOperationsResponse.unreachable] field. This can only be `true` when reading across collections e.g. when `parent` is set to `"projects/example/locations/-"`. This field is not by default supported and will result in an `UNIMPLEMENTED` error if set unless explicitly documented otherwise in service or product specific documentation. |

#### `projects.locations.operations.get()`

Gets the latest state of a long-running operation. Clients can use this method to poll the operation result at intervals as recommended by the API service.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.name` | `string` | Yes | The name of the operation resource. |

#### `projects.locations.operations.delete()`

Deletes a long-running operation. This method indicates that the client is no longer interested in the operation result. It does not cancel the operation. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.name` | `string` | Yes | The name of the operation resource to be deleted. |

#### `projects.locations.operations.cancel()`

Starts asynchronous cancellation on a long-running operation. The server makes a best effort to cancel the operation, but success is not guaranteed. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`. Clients can use Operations.GetOperation or other methods to check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether the operation completed despite cancellation. On successful cancellation, the operation is not deleted; instead, it becomes an operation with an Operation.error value with a google.rpc.Status.code of `1`, corresponding to `Code.CANCELLED`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.name` | `string` | Yes | The name of the operation resource to be cancelled. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

| `params.pageSize` | `integer` | No | Optional. When requesting a 'page' of resources, `page_size` specifies number of resources to return. If unspecified or set to 0, all resources will be returned. |

| `params.filter` | `string` | No | Optional. Lists Memberships that match the filter expression, following the syntax outlined in https://google.aip.dev/160. Examples: - Name is `bar` in project `foo-proj` and location `global`: name = "projects/foo-proj/locations/global/membership/bar" - Memberships that have a label called `foo`: labels.foo:* - Memberships that have a label called `foo` whose value is `bar`: labels.foo = bar - Memberships in the CREATING state: state = CREATING |

Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server will guarantee that for at least 60 minutes after the first request. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |

| `params.namespace` | `string` | No | Optional. Namespace for GKE Connect agent resources. Defaults to `gke-connect`. The Connect Agent is authorized automatically when run in the default namespace. Otherwise, explicit authorization must be granted with an additional IAM binding. |

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.parent` | `string` | Yes | Required. The parent (project and location) where the Memberships will be created. Specified in the format `projects/*/locations/*`. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `projects.locations.memberships.validateExclusivity()`

#### `projects.locations.memberships.generateExclusivityManifest()`

GenerateExclusivityManifest generates the manifests to update the exclusivity artifacts in the cluster if needed. Exclusivity artifacts include the Membership custom resource definition (CRD) and the singleton Membership custom resource (CR). Combined with ValidateExclusivity, exclusivity artifacts guarantee that a Kubernetes cluster is only registered to a single GKE Hub. The Membership CRD is versioned, and may require conversion when the GKE Hub API server begins serving a newer version of the CRD and corresponding CR. The response will be the converted CRD and CR if there are any differences between the versions.

| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `projects.locations.memberships.getIamPolicy()`

Gets the access control policy for a resource. Returns an empty policy if the resource exists and does not have a policy set.

|---|---|---|---|
| `params.resource` | `string` | Yes | REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy is being requested. See [Resource names](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names) for the appropriate value for this field. |
| `params.options.requestedPolicyVersion` | `integer` | No | Optional. The maximum policy version that will be used to format the policy. Valid values are 0, 1, and 3. Requests specifying an invalid value will be rejected. Requests for policies with any conditional role bindings must specify version 3. Policies with no conditional role bindings may specify any valid value or leave the field unset. The policy in the response might use the policy version that you specified, or it might use a lower policy version. For example, if you specify version 3, but the policy has no conditional role bindings, the response uses version 1. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). |

#### `projects.locations.memberships.testIamPermissions()`
