## API Reference

### `operations`

#### `operations.list()`

Lists operations that match the specified filter in the request. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns `UNIMPLEMENTED`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.pageSize` | `integer` | No | The standard list page size. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | When set to `true`, operations that are reachable are returned as normal, and those that are unreachable are returned in the ListOperationsResponse.unreachable field. This can only be `true` when reading across collections. For example, when `parent` is set to `"projects/example/locations/-"`. This field is not supported by default and will result in an `UNIMPLEMENTED` error if set unless explicitly documented otherwise in service or product specific documentation. |
