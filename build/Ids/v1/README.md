## API Reference

### `projects`

### `projects.locations`

#### `projects.locations.list()`

Lists information about the supported locations for this service.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.name` | `string` | Yes | The resource that owns the locations collection, if applicable. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter to narrow down results to a preferred subset. The filtering language accepts strings like `"displayName=tokyo"`, and is documented in more detail in [AIP-160](https://google.aip.dev/160). |
| `params.pageSize` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results to return. If not set, the service selects a default. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | A page token received from the `next_page_token` field in the response. Send that page token to receive the subsequent page. |
| `params.extraLocationTypes` | `string` | No | Optional. A list of extra location types that should be used as conditions for controlling the visibility of the locations. |

#### `projects.locations.get()`

Gets information about a location.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.name` | `string` | Yes | Resource name for the location. |

### `projects.locations.operations`

#### `projects.locations.operations.list()`

Lists operations that match the specified filter in the request. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns `UNIMPLEMENTED`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.name` | `string` | Yes | The name of the operation's parent resource. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | The standard list filter. |
| `params.pageSize` | `integer` | No | The standard list page size. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | The standard list page token. |

#### `projects.locations.operations.get()`

Gets the latest state of a long-running operation. Clients can use this method to poll the operation result at intervals as recommended by the API service.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.name` | `string` | Yes | The name of the operation resource. |

#### `projects.locations.operations.delete()`

Deletes a long-running operation. This method indicates that the client is no longer interested in the operation result. It does not cancel the operation. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.name` | `string` | Yes | The name of the operation resource to be deleted. |

#### `projects.locations.operations.cancel()`

Starts asynchronous cancellation on a long-running operation. The server makes a best effort to cancel the operation, but success is not guaranteed. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`. Clients can use Operations.GetOperation or other methods to check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether the operation completed despite cancellation. On successful cancellation, the operation is not deleted; instead, it becomes an operation with an Operation.error value with a google.rpc.Status.code of `1`, corresponding to `Code.CANCELLED`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.name` | `string` | Yes | The name of the operation resource to be cancelled. |
| `params.resource` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

### `projects.locations.endpoints`

#### `projects.locations.endpoints.list()`

Lists Endpoints in a given project and location.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.parent` | `string` | Yes | Required. The parent, which owns this collection of endpoints. |
| `params.pageSize` | `integer` | No | Optional. The maximum number of endpoints to return. The service may return fewer than this value. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Optional. A page token, received from a previous `ListEndpoints` call. Provide this to retrieve the subsequent page. When paginating, all other parameters provided to `ListEndpoints` must match the call that provided the page token. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | Optional. The filter expression, following the syntax outlined in https://google.aip.dev/160. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Optional. One or more fields to compare and use to sort the output. See https://google.aip.dev/132#ordering. |

#### `projects.locations.endpoints.get()`

Gets details of a single Endpoint.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.name` | `string` | Yes | Required. The name of the endpoint to retrieve. Format: projects/{project}/locations/{location}/endpoints/{endpoint} |

#### `projects.locations.endpoints.create()`

Creates a new Endpoint in a given project and location.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.parent` | `string` | Yes | Required. The endpoint's parent. |
| `params.endpointId` | `string` | No | Required. The endpoint identifier. This will be part of the endpoint's resource name. This value must start with a lowercase letter followed by up to 62 lowercase letters, numbers, or hyphens, and cannot end with a hyphen. Values that do not match this pattern will trigger an INVALID_ARGUMENT error. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server will guarantee that for at least 60 minutes since the first request. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.resource` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `projects.locations.endpoints.patch()`

Updates the parameters of a single Endpoint.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.name` | `string` | Yes | Output only. The name of the endpoint. |
| `params.updateMask` | `string` | No | Field mask is used to specify the fields to be overwritten in the Endpoint resource by the update. The fields specified in the update_mask are relative to the resource, not the full request. A field will be overwritten if it is in the mask. If the user does not provide a mask then all fields will be overwritten. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server will guarantee that for at least 60 minutes since the first request. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.resource` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `projects.locations.endpoints.delete()`

Deletes a single Endpoint.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.name` | `string` | Yes | Required. The name of the endpoint to delete. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server will guarantee that for at least 60 minutes after the first request. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
