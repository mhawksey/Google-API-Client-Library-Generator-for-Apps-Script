## API Reference

### `projects`

### `projects.locations`

#### `projects.locations.list()`

Lists information about the supported locations for this service.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.name` | `string` | Yes | The resource that owns the locations collection, if applicable. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter to narrow down results to a preferred subset. The filtering language accepts strings like `"displayName=tokyo"`, and is documented in more detail in [AIP-160](https://google.aip.dev/160). |
| `params.pageSize` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results to return. If not set, the service selects a default. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | A page token received from the `next_page_token` field in the response. Send that page token to receive the subsequent page. |
| `params.extraLocationTypes` | `string` | No | Optional. Unless explicitly documented otherwise, don't use this unsupported field which is primarily intended for internal usage. |

### `projects.locations.operations`

#### `projects.locations.operations.list()`

Lists operations that match the specified filter in the request. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns `UNIMPLEMENTED`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.name` | `string` | Yes | The name of the operation's parent resource. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | The standard list filter. |
| `params.pageSize` | `integer` | No | The standard list page size. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | The standard list page token. |
| `params.returnPartialSuccess` | `boolean` | No | When set to `true`, operations that are reachable are returned as normal, and those that are unreachable are returned in the [ListOperationsResponse.unreachable] field. This can only be `true` when reading across collections e.g. when `parent` is set to `"projects/example/locations/-"`. This field is not by default supported and will result in an `UNIMPLEMENTED` error if set unless explicitly documented otherwise in service or product specific documentation. |

#### `projects.locations.operations.get()`

Gets the latest state of a long-running operation. Clients can use this method to poll the operation result at intervals as recommended by the API service.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.name` | `string` | Yes | The name of the operation resource. |

### `projects.locations.functions`

#### `projects.locations.functions.get()`

Returns a function with the given name from the requested project.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.name` | `string` | Yes | Required. The name of the function which details should be obtained. |
| `params.revision` | `string` | No | Optional. The optional version of the 1st gen function whose details should be obtained. The version of a 1st gen function is an integer that starts from 1 and gets incremented on redeployments. GCF may keep historical configs for old versions of 1st gen function. This field can be specified to fetch the historical configs. This field is valid only for GCF 1st gen function. |

#### `projects.locations.functions.list()`

Returns a list of functions that belong to the requested project.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.parent` | `string` | Yes | Required. The project and location from which the function should be listed, specified in the format `projects/*/locations/*` If you want to list functions in all locations, use "-" in place of a location. When listing functions in all locations, if one or more location(s) are unreachable, the response will contain functions from all reachable locations along with the names of any unreachable locations. |
| `params.pageSize` | `integer` | No | Maximum number of functions to return per call. The largest allowed page_size is 1,000, if the page_size is omitted or specified as greater than 1,000 then it will be replaced as 1,000. The size of the list response can be less than specified when used with filters. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | The value returned by the last `ListFunctionsResponse`; indicates that this is a continuation of a prior `ListFunctions` call, and that the system should return the next page of data. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | The filter for Functions that match the filter expression, following the syntax outlined in https://google.aip.dev/160. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | The sorting order of the resources returned. Value should be a comma separated list of fields. The default sorting order is ascending. See https://google.aip.dev/132#ordering. |

#### `projects.locations.functions.generateUploadUrl()`

Returns a signed URL for uploading a function source code. For more information about the signed URL usage see: https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/signed-urls. Once the function source code upload is complete, the used signed URL should be provided in CreateFunction or UpdateFunction request as a reference to the function source code. When uploading source code to the generated signed URL, please follow these restrictions:

* Source file type should be a zip file.

* No credentials should be attached - the signed URLs provide access to the target bucket using internal service identity; if credentials were attached, the identity from the credentials would be used, but that identity does not have permissions to upload files to the URL. When making a HTTP PUT request, specify this header:

* `content-type: application/zip` Do not specify this header:

* `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN`

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.resource` | `string` | Yes | REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy is being specified. See [Resource names](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names) for the appropriate value for this field. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `projects.locations.functions.getIamPolicy()`

Gets the access control policy for a resource. Returns an empty policy if the resource exists and does not have a policy set.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.resource` | `string` | Yes | REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy is being requested. See [Resource names](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names) for the appropriate value for this field. |

Requests specifying an invalid value will be rejected. Requests for policies with any conditional role bindings must specify version 3. Policies with no conditional role bindings may specify any valid value or leave the field unset. The policy in the response might use the policy version that you specified, or it might use a lower policy version. For example, if you specify version 3, but the policy has no conditional role bindings, the response uses version 1. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). |

#### `projects.locations.functions.testIamPermissions()`

Returns permissions that a caller has on the specified resource. If the resource does not exist, this will return an empty set of permissions, not a `NOT_FOUND` error.
