## API Reference

### `projects`

### `projects.locations`

#### `projects.locations.searchAssignments()`

Deprecated: Looks up assignments for a specified resource for a particular region. If the request is about a project: 1. Assignments created on the project will be returned if they exist. 2. Otherwise assignments created on the closest ancestor will be returned. 3. Assignments for different JobTypes will all be returned. The same logic applies if the request is about a folder. If the request is about an organization, then assignments created on the organization will be returned (organization doesn't have ancestors). Comparing to ListAssignments, there are some behavior differences: 1. permission on the assignee will be verified in this API. 2. Hierarchy lookup (project->folder->organization) happens in this API. 3. Parent here is `projects/*/locations/*`, instead of `projects/*/locations/*reservations/*`. **Note** "-" cannot be used for projects nor locations.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.parent` | `string` | Yes | Required. The resource name of the admin project(containing project and location), e.g.: `projects/myproject/locations/US`. |
| `params.query` | `string` | No | Please specify resource name as assignee in the query. Examples: * `assignee=projects/myproject` * `assignee=folders/123` * `assignee=organizations/456` |
| `params.pageSize` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of items to return per page. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | The next_page_token value returned from a previous List request, if any. |

#### `projects.locations.searchAllAssignments()`

Looks up assignments for a specified resource for a particular region. If the request is about a project: 1. Assignments created on the project will be returned if they exist. 2. Otherwise assignments created on the closest ancestor will be returned. 3. Assignments for different JobTypes will all be returned. The same logic applies if the request is about a folder. If the request is about an organization, then assignments created on the organization will be returned (organization doesn't have ancestors). Comparing to ListAssignments, there are some behavior differences: 1. permission on the assignee will be verified in this API. 2.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.resource` | `string` | Yes | REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy is being requested. See [Resource names](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names) for the appropriate value for this field. |

The policy in the response might use the policy version that you specified, or it might use a lower policy version. For example, if you specify version 3, but the policy has no conditional role bindings, the response uses version 1. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). |

#### `projects.locations.reservations.setIamPolicy()`

Sets an access control policy for a resource. Replaces any existing policy. Supported resources are: - Reservations To call this method, you must have the following Google IAM permissions: - `bigqueryreservation.reservations.setIamPolicy` to set policies on reservations.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.resource` | `string` | Yes | REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy is being specified. See [Resource names](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names) for the appropriate value for this field. |

### `projects.locations.reservations.assignments`

#### `projects.locations.reservations.assignments.create()`

Creates an assignment object which allows the given project to submit jobs of a certain type using slots from the specified reservation. Currently a resource (project, folder, organization) can only have one assignment per each (job_type, location) combination, and that reservation will be used for all jobs of the matching type. Different assignments can be created on different levels of the projects, folders or organization hierarchy. During query execution, the assignment is looked up at the project, folder and organization levels in that order. The first assignment found is applied to the query. When creating assignments, it does not matter if other assignments exist at higher levels. Example:

* The organization `organizationA` contains two projects, `project1` and `project2`.

* Assignments for all three entities (`organizationA`, `project1`, and `project2`) could all be created and mapped to the same or different reservations. "None" assignments represent an absence of the assignment. Projects assigned to None use on-demand pricing. To create a "None" assignment, use "none" as a reservation_id in the parent. Example parent: `projects/myproject/locations/US/reservations/none`. Returns `google.rpc.Code.PERMISSION_DENIED` if user does not have 'bigquery.admin' permissions on the project using the reservation and the project that owns this reservation. Returns `google.rpc.Code.INVALID_ARGUMENT` when location of the assignment does not match location of the reservation.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.parent` | `string` | Yes | Required. The parent resource name of the assignment E.g. `projects/myproject/locations/US/reservations/team1-prod` |
| `params.assignmentId` | `string` | No | The optional assignment ID. Assignment name will be generated automatically if this field is empty. This field must only contain lower case alphanumeric characters or dashes. Max length is 64 characters. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `projects.locations.reservations.assignments.list()`

Lists assignments. Only explicitly created assignments will be returned. Example:

* Organization `organizationA` contains two projects, `project1` and `project2`.

* Reservation `res1` exists and was created previously.

* CreateAssignment was used previously to define the following associations between entities and reservations: `` and `` In this example, ListAssignments will just return the above two assignments for reservation `res1`, and no expansion/merge will happen. The wildcard "-" can be used for reservations in the request. In that case all assignments belongs to the specified project and location will be listed. **Note** "-" cannot be used for projects nor locations.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.parent` | `string` | Yes | Required. The parent resource name e.g.: `projects/myproject/locations/US/reservations/team1-prod` Or: `projects/myproject/locations/US/reservations/-` |

* Reservation `res1` exists and was created previously.

* CreateAssignment was used previously to define the following associations between entities and reservations: `` and `` In this example, deletion of the `` assignment won't affect the other assignment ``. After said deletion, queries from `project1` will still use `res1` while queries from `project2` will switch to use on-demand mode.
