## API Reference

### `projects`

### `projects.locations`

#### `projects.locations.list()`

Lists information about the supported locations for this service.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.name` | `string` | Yes | The resource that owns the locations collection, if applicable. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter to narrow down results to a preferred subset. The filtering language accepts strings like `"displayName=tokyo"`, and is documented in more detail in [AIP-160](https://google.aip.dev/160). |
| `params.pageSize` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results to return. If not set, the service selects a default. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | A page token received from the `next_page_token` field in the response. Send that page token to receive the subsequent page. |
| `params.extraLocationTypes` | `string` | No | Optional. A list of extra location types that should be used as conditions for controlling the visibility of the locations. |

#### `projects.locations.get()`

Gets information about a location.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.name` | `string` | Yes | Resource name for the location. |

### `projects.locations.operations`

#### `projects.locations.operations.list()`

Lists operations that match the specified filter in the request. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns `UNIMPLEMENTED`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.name` | `string` | Yes | The name of the operation's parent resource. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | The standard list filter. |
| `params.pageSize` | `integer` | No | The standard list page size. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | The standard list page token. |

#### `projects.locations.operations.get()`

Gets the latest state of a long-running operation. Clients can use this method to poll the operation result at intervals as recommended by the API service.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.name` | `string` | Yes | The name of the operation resource. |

#### `projects.locations.operations.delete()`

Deletes a long-running operation. This method indicates that the client is no longer interested in the operation result. It does not cancel the operation. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.name` | `string` | Yes | The name of the operation resource to be deleted. |

#### `projects.locations.operations.cancel()`

Starts asynchronous cancellation on a long-running operation. The server makes a best effort to cancel the operation, but success is not guaranteed. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`. Clients can use Operations.GetOperation or other methods to check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether the operation completed despite cancellation. On successful cancellation, the operation is not deleted; instead, it becomes an operation with an Operation.error value with a google.rpc.Status.code of `1`, corresponding to `Code.CANCELLED`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.name` | `string` | Yes | The name of the operation resource to be cancelled. |
| `params.resource` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

### `projects.locations.global`

### `projects.locations.global.hubs`

#### `projects.locations.global.hubs.list()`

Lists the Network Connectivity Center hubs associated with a given project.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.parent` | `string` | Yes | Required. The parent resource's name. |
| `params.pageSize` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | The page token. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | A filter expression that filters the results listed in the response. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Sort the results by a certain order. |

#### `projects.locations.global.hubs.get()`

Gets details about a Network Connectivity Center hub.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.name` | `string` | Yes | Required. Name of the Hub resource to get. |

#### `projects.locations.global.hubs.create()`

Creates a new Network Connectivity Center hub in the specified project.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.parent` | `string` | Yes | Required. The parent resource's name of the Hub. |
| `params.hubId` | `string` | No | Optional. Unique id for the Hub to create. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | Optional. A request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server guarantees that a request doesn't result in creation of duplicate commitments for at least 60 minutes. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |
| `params.resource` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `projects.locations.global.hubs.patch()`

Updates the description and/or labels of a Network Connectivity Center hub.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.name` | `string` | Yes | Immutable. The name of a Hub resource. |
| `params.updateMask` | `string` | No | Optional. Field mask is used to specify the fields to be overwritten in the Hub resource by the update. The fields specified in the update_mask are relative to the resource, not the full request. A field will be overwritten if it is in the mask. If the user does not provide a mask then all fields will be overwritten. |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | Optional. A request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server guarantees that a request doesn't result in creation of duplicate commitments for at least 60 minutes. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). |

#### `projects.locations.global.hubs.setIamPolicy()`

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.resource` | `string` | Yes | REQUIRED: The resource for which the policy is being specified. See [Resource names](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names) for the appropriate value for this field. |

Requests specifying an invalid value will be rejected. Requests for policies with any conditional role bindings must specify version 3. Policies with no conditional role bindings may specify any valid value or leave the field unset. The policy in the response might use the policy version that you specified, or it might use a lower policy version. For example, if you specify version 3, but the policy has no conditional role bindings, the response uses version 1.
