## API Reference

### `projects`

#### `projects.translateText()`

Translates input text and returns translated text.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.parent` | `string` | Yes | Required. Project or location to make a call. Must refer to a caller's project. Format: `projects/{project-number-or-id}` or `projects/{project-number-or-id}/locations/{location-id}`. For global calls, use `projects/{project-number-or-id}/locations/global` or `projects/{project-number-or-id}`. Non-global location is required for requests using AutoML models or custom glossaries. Models and glossaries must be within the same region (have same location-id), otherwise an INVALID_ARGUMENT (400) error is returned. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `projects.detectLanguage()`

Detects the language of text within a request.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.parent` | `string` | Yes | Required. Project or location to make a call. Must refer to a caller's project. Format: `projects/{project-number-or-id}/locations/{location-id}` or `projects/{project-number-or-id}`. For global calls, use `projects/{project-number-or-id}/locations/global` or `projects/{project-number-or-id}`. Only models within the same region (has same location-id) can be used. Otherwise an INVALID_ARGUMENT (400) error is returned. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `projects.getSupportedLanguages()`

Returns a list of supported languages for translation.

#### `projects.locations.batchTranslateText()`

Translates a large volume of text in asynchronous batch mode. This function provides real-time output as the inputs are being processed. If caller cancels a request, the partial results (for an input file, it's all or nothing) may still be available on the specified output location. This call returns immediately and you can use google.longrunning.Operation.name to poll the status of the call.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.parent` | `string` | Yes | Required. Location to make a call. Must refer to a caller's project. Format: `projects/{project-number-or-id}/locations/{location-id}`. The `global` location is not supported for batch translation. Only AutoML Translation models or glossaries within the same region (have the same location-id) can be used, otherwise an INVALID_ARGUMENT (400) error is returned. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `projects.locations.batchTranslateDocument()`

Translates a large volume of document in asynchronous batch mode. This function provides real-time output as the inputs are being processed. If caller cancels a request, the partial results (for an input file, it's all or nothing) may still be available on the specified output location. This call returns immediately and you can use google.longrunning.Operation.name to poll the status of the call.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.parent` | `string` | Yes | Required. Location to make a regional call. Format: `projects/{project-number-or-id}/locations/{location-id}`. The `global` location is not supported for batch translation. Only AutoML Translation models or glossaries within the same region (have the same location-id) can be used, otherwise an INVALID_ARGUMENT (400) error is returned. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

### `projects.locations.operations`

#### `projects.locations.operations.list()`

Lists operations that match the specified filter in the request. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns `UNIMPLEMENTED`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.name` | `string` | Yes | The name of the operation's parent resource. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | The standard list filter. |
| `params.pageSize` | `integer` | No | The standard list page size. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | The standard list page token. |

#### `projects.locations.operations.get()`

Gets the latest state of a long-running operation. Clients can use this method to poll the operation result at intervals as recommended by the API service.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.name` | `string` | Yes | The name of the operation resource. |

#### `projects.locations.operations.delete()`

Deletes a long-running operation. This method indicates that the client is no longer interested in the operation result. It does not cancel the operation. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.name` | `string` | Yes | The name of the operation resource to be deleted. |

#### `projects.locations.operations.cancel()`

Starts asynchronous cancellation on a long-running operation. The server makes a best effort to cancel the operation, but success is not guaranteed. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`. Clients can use Operations.GetOperation or other methods to check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether the operation completed despite cancellation. On successful cancellation, the operation is not deleted; instead, it becomes an operation with an Operation.error value with a google.rpc.Status.code of `1`, corresponding to `Code.CANCELLED`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.name` | `string` | Yes | The name of the operation resource to be cancelled. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `projects.locations.operations.wait()`

Waits until the specified long-running operation is done or reaches at most a specified timeout, returning the latest state. If the operation is already done, the latest state is immediately returned. If the timeout specified is greater than the default HTTP/RPC timeout, the HTTP/RPC timeout is used. If the server does not support this method, it returns `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`. Note that this method is on a best-effort basis. It may return the latest state before the specified timeout (including immediately), meaning even an immediate response is no guarantee that the operation is done.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.name` | `string` | Yes | The name of the operation resource to wait on. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

### `projects.locations.glossaries`

#### `projects.locations.glossaries.create()`

Creates a glossary and returns the long-running operation. Returns NOT_FOUND, if the project doesn't exist.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.parent` | `string` | Yes | Required. The project name. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `projects.locations.glossaries.list()`

Lists glossaries in a project. Returns NOT_FOUND, if the project doesn't exist.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.parent` | `string` | Yes | Required. The name of the project from which to list all of the glossaries. |
| `params.pageSize` | `integer` | No | Optional. Requested page size. The server may return fewer glossaries than requested. If unspecified, the server picks an appropriate default. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Optional. A token identifying a page of results the server should return. Typically, this is the value of [ListGlossariesResponse.next_page_token] returned from the previous call to `ListGlossaries` method. The first page is returned if `page_token`is empty or missing. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | Optional. Filter specifying constraints of a list operation. Specify the constraint by the format of "key=value", where key must be "src" or "tgt", and the value must be a valid language code. For multiple restrictions, concatenate them by "AND" (uppercase only), such as: "src=en-US AND tgt=zh-CN". Notice that the exact match is used here, which means using 'en-US' and 'en' can lead to different results, which depends on the language code you used when you create the glossary. For the unidirectional glossaries, the "src" and "tgt" add restrictions on the source and target language code separately. For the equivalent term set glossaries, the "src" and/or "tgt" add restrictions on the term set. For example: "src=en-US AND tgt=zh-CN" will only pick the unidirectional glossaries which exactly match the source language code as "en-US" and the target language code "zh-CN", but all equivalent term set glossaries which contain "en-US" and "zh-CN" in their language set will be picked. If missing, no filtering is performed. |

#### `projects.locations.glossaries.get()`

Gets a glossary. Returns NOT_FOUND, if the glossary doesn't exist.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.name` | `string` | Yes | Required. The name of the glossary to retrieve. |

#### `projects.locations.glossaries.delete()`

Deletes a glossary, or cancels glossary construction if the glossary isn't created yet. Returns NOT_FOUND, if the glossary doesn't exist.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.name` | `string` | Yes | Required. The name of the glossary to delete. |
