## API Reference

### `media`

#### `media.download()`

Downloads media. Download is supported on the URI `/v1/media/{+name}?alt=media`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.resourceName` | `string` | Yes | Name of the media that is being downloaded. See ReadRequest.resource_name. |

#### `media.upload()`

Uploads an attachment. For an example, see [Upload media as a file attachment](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/upload-media-attachments). Requires user [authentication](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize-chat-user) with one of the following [authorization scopes](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize#chat-api-scopes): - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/chat.messages.create` - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/chat.messages` - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/chat.import` (import mode spaces only) You can upload attachments up to 200 MB. Certain file types aren't supported. For details, see [File types blocked by Google Chat](https://support.google.com/chat/answer/7651457?&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop#File%20types%20blocked%20in%20Google%20Chat).

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.parent` | `string` | Yes | Required. Resource name of the Chat space in which the attachment is uploaded. Format "spaces/{space}". |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

### `spaces`

#### `spaces.list()`

Lists spaces the caller is a member of. Group chats and DMs aren't listed until the first message is sent. For an example, see [List spaces](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/list-spaces). Supports the following types of [authentication](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize): - [App authentication](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize-chat-app) with the authorization scope: - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/chat.bot` - [User authentication](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize-chat-user) with one of the following authorization scopes: - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/chat.spaces.readonly` - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/chat.spaces` To list all named spaces by Google Workspace organization, use the [`spaces.search()`](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/api/reference/rest/v1/spaces/search) method using Workspace administrator privileges instead.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.pageSize` | `integer` | No | Optional. The maximum number of spaces to return. The service might return fewer than this value. If unspecified, at most 100 spaces are returned. The maximum value is 1000. If you use a value more than 1000, it's automatically changed to 1000. Negative values return an `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Optional. A page token, received from a previous list spaces call. Provide this parameter to retrieve the subsequent page. When paginating, the filter value should match the call that provided the page token. Passing a different value may lead to unexpected results. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | Optional. A query filter. You can filter spaces by the space type ([`space_type`](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/api/reference/rest/v1/spaces#spacetype)). To filter by space type, you must specify valid enum value, such as `SPACE` or `GROUP_CHAT` (the `space_type` can't be `SPACE_TYPE_UNSPECIFIED`). To query for multiple space types, use the `OR` operator. For example, the following queries are valid: ``` space_type = "SPACE" spaceType = "GROUP_CHAT" OR spaceType = "DIRECT_MESSAGE" ``` Invalid queries are rejected by the server with an `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error. |

#### `spaces.search()`

Returns a list of spaces in a Google Workspace organization based on an administrator's search. In the request, set `use_admin_access` to `true`. For an example, see [Search for and manage spaces](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/search-manage-admin). Requires [user authentication with administrator privileges](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize-chat-user#admin-privileges) and one of the following [authorization scopes](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize#chat-api-scopes): - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/chat.admin.spaces.readonly` - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/chat.admin.spaces`

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.useAdminAccess` | `boolean` | No | When `true`, the method runs using the user's Google Workspace administrator privileges. The calling user must be a Google Workspace administrator with the [manage chat and spaces conversations privilege](https://support.google.com/a/answer/13369245). Requires either the `chat.admin.spaces.readonly` or `chat.admin.spaces` [OAuth 2.0 scope](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize#chat-api-scopes). This method currently only supports admin access, thus only `true` is accepted for this field. |
| `params.pageSize` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of spaces to return. The service may return fewer than this value. If unspecified, at most 100 spaces are returned. The maximum value is 1000. If you use a value more than 1000, it's automatically changed to 1000. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | A token, received from the previous search spaces call. Provide this parameter to retrieve the subsequent page. When paginating, all other parameters provided should match the call that provided the page token. Passing different values to the other parameters might lead to unexpected results. |
| `params.query` | `string` | No | Required. A search query. You can search by using the following parameters: - `create_time` - `customer` - `display_name` - `external_user_allowed` - `last_active_time` - `space_history_state` - `space_type` `create_time` and `last_active_time` accept a timestamp in [RFC-3339](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3339) format and the supported comparison operators are: `=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`. `customer` is required and is used to indicate which customer to fetch spaces from. `customers/my_customer` is the only supported value. `display_name` only accepts the `HAS` (`:`) operator. The text to match is first tokenized into tokens and each token is prefix-matched case-insensitively and independently as a substring anywhere in the space's `display_name`. For example, `Fun Eve` matches `Fun event` or `The evening was fun`, but not `notFun event` or `even`. `external_user_allowed` accepts either `true` or `false`. `space_history_state` only accepts values from the [`historyState`] (https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/api/reference/rest/v1/spaces#Space.HistoryState) field of a `space` resource. `space_type` is required and the only valid value is `SPACE`. Across different fields, only `AND` operators are supported. A valid example is `space_type = "SPACE" AND display_name:"Hello"` and an invalid example is `space_type = "SPACE" OR display_name:"Hello"`. Among the same field, `space_type` doesn't support `AND` or `OR` operators. `display_name`, 'space_history_state', and 'external_user_allowed' only support `OR` operators. `last_active_time` and `create_time` support both `AND` and `OR` operators. `AND` can only be used to represent an interval, such as `last_active_time < "2022-01-01T00:00:00+00:00" AND last_active_time > "2023-01-01T00:00:00+00:00"`. The following example queries are valid: ``` customer = "customers/my_customer" AND space_type = "SPACE" customer = "customers/my_customer" AND space_type = "SPACE" AND display_name:"Hello World" customer = "customers/my_customer" AND space_type = "SPACE" AND (last_active_time < "2020-01-01T00:00:00+00:00" OR last_active_time > "2022-01-01T00:00:00+00:00") customer = "customers/my_customer" AND space_type = "SPACE" AND (display_name:"Hello World" OR display_name:"Fun event") AND (last_active_time > "2020-01-01T00:00:00+00:00" AND last_active_time < "2022-01-01T00:00:00+00:00") customer = "customers/my_customer" AND space_type = "SPACE" AND (create_time > "2019-01-01T00:00:00+00:00" AND create_time < "2020-01-01T00:00:00+00:00") AND (external_user_allowed = "true") AND (space_history_state = "HISTORY_ON" OR space_history_state = "HISTORY_OFF") ``` |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Optional. How the list of spaces is ordered. Supported attributes to order by are: - `membership_count.joined_direct_human_user_count` — Denotes the count of human users that have directly joined a space. - `last_active_time` — Denotes the time when last eligible item is added to any topic of this space. - `create_time` — Denotes the time of the space creation. Valid ordering operation values are: - `ASC` for ascending. Default value. - `DESC` for descending. The supported syntax are: - `membership_count.joined_direct_human_user_count DESC` - `membership_count.joined_direct_human_user_count ASC` - `last_active_time DESC` - `last_active_time ASC` - `create_time DESC` - `create_time ASC` |

#### `spaces.get()`

Returns details about a space. For an example, see [Get details about a space](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/get-spaces). Supports the following types of [authentication](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize): - [App authentication](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize-chat-app) with one of the following authorization scopes: - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/chat.bot` - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/chat.app.spaces` with [administrator approval](https://support.google.com/a?p=chat-app-auth) - [User authentication](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize-chat-user) with one of the following authorization scopes: - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/chat.spaces.readonly` - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/chat.spaces` - User authentication grants administrator privileges when an administrator account authenticates, `use_admin_access` is `true`, and one of the following authorization scopes is used: - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/chat.admin.spaces.readonly` - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/chat.admin.spaces` App authentication has the following limitations: - `space.access_settings` is only populated when using the `chat.app.spaces` scope. - `space.predefind_permission_settings` and `space.permission_settings` are only populated when using the `chat.app.spaces` scope, and only for spaces the app created.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.name` | `string` | Yes | Required. Resource name of the space, in the form `spaces/{space}`. Format: `spaces/{space}` |
| `params.useAdminAccess` | `boolean` | No | Optional. When `true`, the method runs using the user's Google Workspace administrator privileges. The calling user must be a Google Workspace administrator with the [manage chat and spaces conversations privilege](https://support.google.com/a/answer/13369245). Requires the `chat.admin.spaces` or `chat.admin.spaces.readonly` [OAuth 2.0 scopes](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize#chat-api-scopes). |

#### `spaces.create()`

Creates a space. Can be used to create a named space, or a group chat in `Import mode`. For an example, see [Create a space](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/create-spaces). Supports the following types of [authentication](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize): - [App authentication](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize-chat-app) with [administrator approval](https://support.google.com/a?p=chat-app-auth) and one of the following authorization scopes: - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/chat.app.spaces.create` - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/chat.app.spaces` - [User authentication](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize-chat-user) with one of the following authorization scopes: - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/chat.spaces.create` - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/chat.spaces` - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/chat.import` (import mode spaces only) When authenticating as an app, the `space.customer` field must be set in the request. When authenticating as an app, the Chat app is added as a member of the space. However, unlike human authentication, the Chat app is not added as a space manager. By default, the Chat app can be removed from the space by all space members. To allow only space managers to remove the app from a space, set `space.permission_settings.manage_apps` to `managers_allowed`. Space membership upon creation depends on whether the space is created in `Import mode`:

* **Import mode:** No members are created.

* **All other modes:** The calling user is added as a member. This is:

* The app itself when using app authentication.

* The human user when using user authentication. If you receive the error message `ALREADY_EXISTS` when creating a space, try a different `displayName`. An existing space within the Google Workspace organization might already use this display name.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | Optional. A unique identifier for this request. A random UUID is recommended. Specifying an existing request ID returns the space created with that ID instead of creating a new space. Specifying an existing request ID from the same Chat app with a different authenticated user returns an error. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `spaces.setup()`

Creates a space and adds specified users to it. The calling user is automatically added to the space, and shouldn't be specified as a membership in the request. For an example, see [Set up a space with initial members](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/set-up-spaces). To specify the human members to add, add memberships with the appropriate `membership.member.name`. To add a human user, use `users/{user}`, where `{user}` can be the email address for the user. For users in the same Workspace organization `{user}` can also be the `id` for the person from the People API, or the `id` for the user in the Directory API. For example, if the People API Person profile ID for `user@example.com` is `123456789`, you can add the user to the space by setting the `membership.member.name` to `users/user@example.com` or `users/123456789`. To specify the Google groups to add, add memberships with the appropriate `membership.group_member.name`. To add or invite a Google group, use `groups/{group}`, where `{group}` is the `id` for the group from the Cloud Identity Groups API. For example, you can use [Cloud Identity Groups lookup API](https://cloud.google.com/identity/docs/reference/rest/v1/groups/lookup) to retrieve the ID `123456789` for group email `group@example.com`, then you can add the group to the space by setting the `membership.group_member.name` to `groups/123456789`. Group email is not supported, and Google groups can only be added as members in named spaces. For a named space or group chat, if the caller blocks, or is blocked by some members, or doesn't have permission to add some members, then those members aren't added to the created space. To create a direct message (DM) between the calling user and another human user, specify exactly one membership to represent the human user. If one user blocks the other, the request fails and the DM isn't created. To create a DM between the calling user and the calling app, set `Space.singleUserBotDm` to `true` and don't specify any memberships. You can only use this method to set up a DM with the calling app. To add the calling app as a member of a space or an existing DM between two human users, see [Invite or add a user or app to a space](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/create-members). If a DM already exists between two users, even when one user blocks the other at the time a request is made, then the existing DM is returned. Spaces with threaded replies aren't supported. If you receive the error message `ALREADY_EXISTS` when setting up a space, try a different `displayName`. An existing space within the Google Workspace organization might already use this display name. Requires [user authentication](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize-chat-user) with one of the following [authorization scopes](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize#chat-api-scopes): - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/chat.spaces.create` - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/chat.spaces`

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `spaces.patch()`

Updates a space. For an example, see [Update a space](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/update-spaces). If you're updating the `displayName` field and receive the error message `ALREADY_EXISTS`, try a different display name.. An existing space within the Google Workspace organization might already use this display name. Supports the following types of [authentication](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize): - [App authentication](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize-chat-app) with [administrator approval](https://support.google.com/a?p=chat-app-auth) and one of the following authorization scopes: - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/chat.app.spaces` - [User authentication](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize-chat-user) with one of the following authorization scopes: - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/chat.spaces` - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/chat.import` (import mode spaces only) - User authentication grants administrator privileges when an administrator account authenticates, `use_admin_access` is `true`, and the following authorization scopes is used: - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/chat.admin.spaces` App authentication has the following limitations: - To update either `space.predefined_permission_settings` or `space.permission_settings`, the app must be the space creator. - Updating the `space.access_settings.audience` is not supported for app authentication.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.name` | `string` | Yes | Identifier. Resource name of the space. Format: `spaces/{space}` Where `{space}` represents the system-assigned ID for the space. You can obtain the space ID by calling the [`spaces.list()`](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/api/reference/rest/v1/spaces/list) method or from the space URL. For example, if the space URL is `https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#chat/space/AAAAAAAAA`, the space ID is `AAAAAAAAA`. |
| `params.updateMask` | `string` | No | Required. The updated field paths, comma separated if there are multiple. You can update the following fields for a space: `space_details`: Updates the space's description. Supports up to 150 characters. `display_name`: Only supports updating the display name for spaces where `spaceType` field is `SPACE`. If you receive the error message `ALREADY_EXISTS`, try a different value. An existing space within the Google Workspace organization might already use this display name. `space_type`: Only supports changing a `GROUP_CHAT` space type to `SPACE`. Include `display_name` together with `space_type` in the update mask and ensure that the specified space has a non-empty display name and the `SPACE` space type. Including the `space_type` mask and the `SPACE` type in the specified space when updating the display name is optional if the existing space already has the `SPACE` type. Trying to update the space type in other ways results in an invalid argument error. `space_type` is not supported with `useAdminAccess`. `space_history_state`: Updates [space history settings](https://support.google.com/chat/answer/7664687) by turning history on or off for the space. Only supported if history settings are enabled for the Google Workspace organization. To update the space history state, you must omit all other field masks in your request. `space_history_state` is not supported with `useAdminAccess`. `access_settings.audience`: Updates the [access setting](https://support.google.com/chat/answer/11971020) of who can discover the space, join the space, and preview the messages in named space where `spaceType` field is `SPACE`. If the existing space has a target audience, you can remove the audience and restrict space access by omitting a value for this field mask. To update access settings for a space, the authenticating user must be a space manager and omit all other field masks in your request. You can't update this field if the space is in [import mode](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/import-data-overview). To learn more, see [Make a space discoverable to specific users](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/space-target-audience). `access_settings.audience` is not supported with `useAdminAccess`. `permission_settings`: Supports changing the [permission settings](https://support.google.com/chat/answer/13340792) of a space. When updating permission settings, you can only specify `permissionSettings` field masks; you cannot update other field masks at the same time. `permissionSettings` is not supported with `useAdminAccess`. The supported field masks include: - `permission_settings.manageMembersAndGroups` - `permission_settings.modifySpaceDetails` - `permission_settings.toggleHistory` - `permission_settings.useAtMentionAll` - `permission_settings.manageApps` - `permission_settings.manageWebhooks` - `permission_settings.replyMessages` |
| `params.useAdminAccess` | `boolean` | No | Optional. When `true`, the method runs using the user's Google Workspace administrator privileges. The calling user must be a Google Workspace administrator with the [manage chat and spaces conversations privilege](https://support.google.com/a/answer/13369245). Requires the `chat.admin.spaces` [OAuth 2.0 scope](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize#chat-api-scopes). Some `FieldMask` values are not supported using admin access. For details, see the description of `update_mask`. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `spaces.delete()`

Deletes a named space. Always performs a cascading delete, which means that the space's child resources—like messages posted in the space and memberships in the space—are also deleted. For an example, see [Delete a space](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/delete-spaces). Supports the following types of [authentication](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize): - [App authentication](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize-chat-app) with [administrator approval](https://support.google.com/a?p=chat-app-auth) and the authorization scope: - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/chat.app.delete` (only in spaces the app created) - [User authentication](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize-chat-user) with one of the following authorization scopes: - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/chat.delete` - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/chat.import` (import mode spaces only) - User authentication grants administrator privileges when an administrator account authenticates, `use_admin_access` is `true`, and the following authorization scope is used: - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/chat.admin.delete`

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.name` | `string` | Yes | Required. Resource name of the space to delete. Format: `spaces/{space}` |
| `params.useAdminAccess` | `boolean` | No | Optional. When `true`, the method runs using the user's Google Workspace administrator privileges. The calling user must be a Google Workspace administrator with the [manage chat and spaces conversations privilege](https://support.google.com/a/answer/13369245). Requires the `chat.admin.delete` [OAuth 2.0 scope](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize#chat-api-scopes). |

#### `spaces.completeImport()`

Completes the [import process](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/import-data) for the specified space and makes it visible to users. Requires [user authentication](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize-chat-user) and domain-wide delegation with the [authorization scope](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize#chat-api-scopes): - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/chat.import` For more information, see [Authorize Google Chat apps to import data](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authorize-import).

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.name` | `string` | Yes | Required. Resource name of the import mode space. Format: `spaces/{space}` |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `spaces.findDirectMessage()`

Returns the existing direct message with the specified user. If no direct message space is found, returns a `404 NOT_FOUND` error. For an example, see [Find a direct message](/chat/api/guides/v1/spaces/find-direct-message). With [app authentication](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize-chat-app), returns the direct message space between the specified user and the calling Chat app. With [user authentication](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize-chat-user), returns the direct message space between the specified user and the authenticated user. Supports the following types of [authentication](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize): - [App authentication](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize-chat-app) with the authorization scope: - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/chat.bot` - [User authentication](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize-chat-user) with one of the following authorization scopes: - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/chat.spaces.readonly` - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/chat.spaces`

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.name` | `string` | No | Required. Resource name of the user to find direct message with. Format: `users/{user}`, where `{user}` is either the `id` for the [person](https://developers.google.com/people/api/rest/v1/people) from the People API, or the `id` for the [user](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/directory/reference/rest/v1/users) in the Directory API. For example, if the People API profile ID is `123456789`, you can find a direct message with that person by using `users/123456789` as the `name`. When [authenticated as a user](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize-chat-user), you can use the email as an alias for `{user}`. For example, `users/example@gmail.com` where `example@gmail.com` is the email of the Google Chat user. |

### `spaces.messages`

#### `spaces.messages.create()`

Creates a message in a Google Chat space. For an example, see [Send a message](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/create-messages). Supports the following types of [authentication](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize): - [App authentication](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize-chat-app) with the authorization scope: - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/chat.bot` - [User authentication](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize-chat-user) with one of the following authorization scopes: - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/chat.messages.create` - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/chat.messages` - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/chat.import` (import mode spaces only) Chat attributes the message sender differently depending on the type of authentication that you use in your request. The following image shows how Chat attributes a message when you use app authentication. Chat displays the Chat app as the message sender. The content of the message can contain text (`text`), cards (`cardsV2`), and accessory widgets (`accessoryWidgets`). ![Message sent with app authentication](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/images/message-app-auth.svg) The following image shows how Chat attributes a message when you use user authentication. Chat displays the user as the message sender and attributes the Chat app to the message by displaying its name. The content of message can only contain text (`text`). ![Message sent with user authentication](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/images/message-user-auth.svg) The maximum message size, including the message contents, is 32,000 bytes. For [webhook](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/quickstart/webhooks) requests, the response doesn't contain the full message. The response only populates the `name` and `thread.name` fields in addition to the information that was in the request.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.parent` | `string` | Yes | Required. The resource name of the space in which to create a message. Format: `spaces/{space}` |
| `params.threadKey` | `string` | No | Optional. Deprecated: Use thread.thread_key instead. ID for the thread. Supports up to 4000 characters. To start or add to a thread, create a message and specify a `threadKey` or the thread.name. For example usage, see [Start or reply to a message thread](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/create-messages#create-message-thread). |
| `params.requestId` | `string` | No | Optional. A unique request ID for this message. Specifying an existing request ID returns the message created with that ID instead of creating a new message. |
| `params.messageReplyOption` | `string` | No | Optional. Specifies whether a message starts a thread or replies to one. Only supported in named spaces. When [responding to user interactions](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/receive-respond-interactions), this field is ignored. For interactions within a thread, the reply is created in the same thread. Otherwise, the reply is created as a new thread. |
| `params.messageId` | `string` | No | Optional. A custom ID for a message. Lets Chat apps get, update, or delete a message without needing to store the system-assigned ID in the message's resource name (represented in the message `name` field). The value for this field must meet the following requirements: * Begins with `client-`. For example, `client-custom-name` is a valid custom ID, but `custom-name` is not. * Contains up to 63 characters and only lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens. * Is unique within a space. A Chat app can't use the same custom ID for different messages. For details, see [Name a message](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/create-messages#name_a_created_message). |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `spaces.messages.list()`

Lists messages in a space that the caller is a member of, including messages from blocked members and spaces. System messages, like those announcing new space members, aren't included. If you list messages from a space with no messages, the response is an empty object. When using a REST/HTTP interface, the response contains an empty JSON object, `{}`. For an example, see [List messages](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/api/guides/v1/messages/list). Supports the following types of [authentication](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize): - [App authentication](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize-chat-app) with [administrator approval](https://support.google.com/a?p=chat-app-auth) in [Developer Preview](https://developers.google.com/workspace/preview) with the authorization scope: - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/chat.app.messages.readonly`. When using this authentication scope, this method only returns public messages in a space. It doesn't include private messages. - [User authentication](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize-chat-user) with one of the following authorization scopes: - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/chat.messages.readonly` - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/chat.messages` - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/chat.import` (import mode spaces only)

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.parent` | `string` | Yes | Required. The resource name of the space to list messages from. Format: `spaces/{space}` |
| `params.pageSize` | `integer` | No | Optional. The maximum number of messages returned. The service might return fewer messages than this value. If unspecified, at most 25 are returned. The maximum value is 1000. If you use a value more than 1000, it's automatically changed to 1000. Negative values return an `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Optional. A page token received from a previous list messages call. Provide this parameter to retrieve the subsequent page. When paginating, all other parameters provided should match the call that provided the page token. Passing different values to the other parameters might lead to unexpected results. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | Optional. A query filter. You can filter messages by date (`create_time`) and thread (`thread.name`). To filter messages by the date they were created, specify the `create_time` with a timestamp in [RFC-3339](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3339) format and double quotation marks. For example, `"2023-04-21T11:30:00-04:00"`. You can use the greater than operator `>` to list messages that were created after a timestamp, or the less than operator `<` to list messages that were created before a timestamp. To filter messages within a time interval, use the `AND` operator between two timestamps. To filter by thread, specify the `thread.name`, formatted as `spaces/{space}/threads/{thread}`. You can only specify one `thread.name` per query. To filter by both thread and date, use the `AND` operator in your query. For example, the following queries are valid: ``` create_time > "2012-04-21T11:30:00-04:00" create_time > "2012-04-21T11:30:00-04:00" AND thread.name = spaces/AAAAAAAAAAA/threads/123 create_time > "2012-04-21T11:30:00+00:00" AND create_time < "2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00" AND thread.name = spaces/AAAAAAAAAAA/threads/123 thread.name = spaces/AAAAAAAAAAA/threads/123 ``` Invalid queries are rejected by the server with an `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error. |
| `params.orderBy` | `string` | No | Optional. How the list of messages is ordered. Specify a value to order by an ordering operation. Valid ordering operation values are as follows: - `ASC` for ascending. - `DESC` for descending. The default ordering is `create_time ASC`. |

### `spaces.spaceEvents`

#### `spaces.spaceEvents.get()`

Returns an event from a Google Chat space. The [event payload](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/api/reference/rest/v1/spaces.spaceEvents#SpaceEvent.FIELDS.oneof_payload) contains the most recent version of the resource that changed. For example, if you request an event about a new message but the message was later updated, the server returns the updated `Message` resource in the event payload. Note: The `permissionSettings` field is not returned in the Space object of the Space event data for this request. Requires [user authentication](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize-chat-user) with an [authorization scope](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize#chat-api-scopes) appropriate for reading the requested data: - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/chat.spaces.readonly` - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/chat.spaces` - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/chat.messages.readonly` - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/chat.messages` - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/chat.messages.reactions.readonly` - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/chat.messages.reactions` - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/chat.memberships.readonly` - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/chat.memberships` To get an event, the authenticated user must be a member of the space.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.name` | `string` | Yes | Required. The resource name of the space event. Format: `spaces/{space}/spaceEvents/{spaceEvent}` |

#### `spaces.spaceEvents.list()`

Lists events from a Google Chat space. For each event, the [payload](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/api/reference/rest/v1/spaces.spaceEvents#SpaceEvent.FIELDS.oneof_payload) contains the most recent version of the Chat resource. For example, if you list events about new space members, the server returns `Membership` resources that contain the latest membership details. If new members were removed during the requested period, the event payload contains an empty `Membership` resource. Requires [user authentication](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize-chat-user) with an [authorization scope](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize#chat-api-scopes) appropriate for reading the requested data: - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/chat.spaces.readonly` - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/chat.spaces` - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/chat.messages.readonly` - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/chat.messages` - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/chat.messages.reactions.readonly` - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/chat.messages.reactions` - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/chat.memberships.readonly` - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/chat.memberships` To list events, the authenticated user must be a member of the space. For an example, see [List events from a Google Chat space](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/list-space-events).

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.parent` | `string` | Yes | Required. Resource name of the [Google Chat space](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/api/reference/rest/v1/spaces) where the events occurred. Format: `spaces/{space}`. |
| `params.pageSize` | `integer` | No | Optional. The maximum number of space events returned. The service might return fewer than this value. Negative values return an `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | Optional. A page token, received from a previous list space events call. Provide this to retrieve the subsequent page. When paginating, all other parameters provided to list space events must match the call that provided the page token. Passing different values to the other parameters might lead to unexpected results. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | Required. A query filter. You must specify at least one event type (`event_type`) using the has `:` operator. To filter by multiple event types, use the `OR` operator. Omit batch event types in your filter. The request automatically returns any related batch events. For example, if you filter by new reactions (`google.workspace.chat.reaction.v1.created`), the server also returns batch new reactions events (`google.workspace.chat.reaction.v1.batchCreated`). For a list of supported event types, see the [`SpaceEvents` reference documentation](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/api/reference/rest/v1/spaces.spaceEvents#SpaceEvent.FIELDS.event_type). Optionally, you can also filter by start time (`start_time`) and end time (`end_time`): * `start_time`: Exclusive timestamp from which to start listing space events. You can list events that occurred up to 28 days ago. If unspecified, lists space events from the past 28 days. * `end_time`: Inclusive timestamp until which space events are listed. If unspecified, lists events up to the time of the request. To specify a start or end time, use the equals `=` operator and format in [RFC-3339](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3339). To filter by both `start_time` and `end_time`, use the `AND` operator. For example, the following queries are valid: ``` start_time="2023-08-23T19:20:33+00:00" AND end_time="2023-08-23T19:21:54+00:00" ``` ``` start_time="2023-08-23T19:20:33+00:00" AND (event_types:"google.workspace.chat.space.v1.updated" OR event_types:"google.workspace.chat.message.v1.created") ``` The following queries are invalid: ``` start_time="2023-08-23T19:20:33+00:00" OR end_time="2023-08-23T19:21:54+00:00" ``` ``` event_types:"google.workspace.chat.space.v1.updated" AND event_types:"google.workspace.chat.message.v1.created" ``` Invalid queries are rejected by the server with an `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error. |
