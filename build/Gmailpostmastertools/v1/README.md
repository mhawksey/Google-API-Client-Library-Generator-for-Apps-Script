## API Reference

### `domains`

#### `domains.get()`

Gets a specific domain registered by the client. Returns NOT_FOUND if the domain does not exist.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |

#### `domains.list()`

Lists the domains that have been registered by the client. The order of domains in the response is unspecified and non-deterministic. Newly created domains will not necessarily be added to the end of this list.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
