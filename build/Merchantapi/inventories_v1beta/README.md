## API Reference

### `accounts`

### `accounts.products`

### `accounts.products.localInventories`

#### `accounts.products.localInventories.list()`

Lists the `LocalInventory` resources for the given product in your merchant account. The response might contain fewer items than specified by `pageSize`. If `pageToken` was returned in previous request, it can be used to obtain additional results. `LocalInventory` resources are listed per product for a given account.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.parent` | `string` | Yes | Required. The `name` of the parent product to list local inventories for. Format: `accounts/{account}/products/{product}` The `{product}` segment is a unique identifier for the product. This identifier must be unique within a merchant account and generally follows the structure: `content_language~feed_label~offer_id`. Example: `en~US~sku123` For legacy local products, the structure is: `local~content_language~feed_label~offer_id`. Example: `local~en~US~sku123` The format of the `{product}` segment in the URL is automatically detected by the server, supporting two options: 1. **Encoded Format**: The `{product}` segment is an unpadded base64url encoded string (RFC 4648 Section 5). The decoded string must result in the `content_language~feed_label~offer_id` structure. This encoding MUST be used if any part of the product identifier (like `offer_id`) contains characters such as `/`, `%`, or `~`. * Example: To represent the product ID `en~US~sku/123`, the `{product}` segment must be the base64url encoding of this string, which is `ZW5-VVMtc2t1LzEyMw`. The full resource name for the product would be `accounts/123/products/ZW5-VVMtc2t1LzEyMw`. 2. **Plain Format**: The `{product}` segment is the tilde-separated string `content_language~feed_label~offer_id`. This format is suitable only when `content_language`, `feed_label`, and `offer_id` do not contain URL-problematic characters like `/`, `%`, or `~`. We recommend using the **Encoded Format** for all product IDs to ensure correct parsing, especially those containing special characters. The presence of tilde (`~`) characters in the `{product}` segment is used to differentiate between the two formats. Note: For calls to the v1beta version, the plain format is `channel~content_language~feed_label~offer_id`, for example: `accounts/123/products/online~en~US~sku123`. |
| `params.pageSize` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of `LocalInventory` resources for the given product to return. The service returns fewer than this value if the number of inventories for the given product is less that than the `pageSize`. The default value is 25000. The maximum value is 25000; If a value higher than the maximum is specified, then the `pageSize` will default to the maximum |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | A page token, received from a previous `ListLocalInventories` call. Provide the page token to retrieve the subsequent page. When paginating, all other parameters provided to `ListLocalInventories` must match the call that provided the page token. The token returned as nextPageToken in the response to the previous request. |

#### `accounts.products.localInventories.insert()`

Inserts a `LocalInventory` resource to a product in your merchant account. Replaces the full `LocalInventory` resource if an entry with the same `storeCode` already exists for the product. It might take up to 30 minutes for the new or updated `LocalInventory` resource to appear in products.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.parent` | `string` | Yes | Required. The account and product where this inventory will be inserted. Format: `accounts/{account}/products/{product}` The `{product}` segment is a unique identifier for the product. This identifier must be unique within a merchant account and generally follows the structure: `content_language~feed_label~offer_id`. Example: `en~US~sku123` For legacy local products, the structure is: `local~content_language~feed_label~offer_id`. Example: `local~en~US~sku123` The format of the `{product}` segment in the URL is automatically detected by the server, supporting two options: 1. **Encoded Format**: The `{product}` segment is an unpadded base64url encoded string (RFC 4648 Section 5).

The full resource name for the product would be `accounts/123/products/ZW5-VVMtc2t1LzEyMw`. 2. **Plain Format**: The `{product}` segment is the tilde-separated string `content_language~feed_label~offer_id`. This format is suitable only when `content_language`, `feed_label`, and `offer_id` do not contain URL-problematic characters like `/`, `%`, or `~`. We recommend using the **Encoded Format** for all product IDs to ensure correct parsing, especially those containing special characters. The presence of tilde (`~`) characters in the `{product}` segment is used to differentiate between the two formats. Note: For calls to the v1beta version, the plain format is `channel~content_language~feed_label~offer_id`, for example: `accounts/123/products/online~en~US~sku123`. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `accounts.products.localInventories.delete()`

Deletes the specified `LocalInventory` from the given product in your merchant account. It might take a up to an hour for the `LocalInventory` to be deleted from the specific product. Once you have received a successful delete response, wait for that period before attempting a delete again.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.name` | `string` | Yes | Required. The name of the local inventory for the given product to delete. Format: `accounts/{account}/products/{product}/localInventories/{store_code}` The `{product}` segment is a unique identifier for the product. This identifier must be unique within a merchant account and generally follows the structure: `content_language~feed_label~offer_id`. Example: `en~US~sku123` For legacy local products, the structure is: `local~content_language~feed_label~offer_id`.

The full resource name for the local inventory would be `accounts/123/products/ZW5-VVMtc2t1LzEyMw/localInventories/store123`. 2. **Plain Format**: The `{product}` segment is the tilde-separated string `content_language~feed_label~offer_id`. This format is suitable only when `content_language`, `feed_label`, and `offer_id` do not contain URL-problematic characters like `/`, `%`, or `~`.
