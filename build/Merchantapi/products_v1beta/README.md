## API Reference

### `accounts`

### `accounts.productInputs`

#### `accounts.productInputs.patch()`

Updates the existing product input in your Merchant Center account. The name of the product input to update is taken from the `name` field within the `ProductInput` resource. After inserting, updating, or deleting a product input, it may take several minutes before the processed product can be retrieved.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.dataSource` | `string` | No | Required. The primary or supplemental product data source where `data_source` name identifies the product input to be updated. Only API data sources are supported. Format: `accounts/{account}/dataSources/{datasource}`. For example, `accounts/123456/dataSources/104628`. |
| `params.updateMask` | `string` | No | Optional. The list of product attributes to be updated. If the update mask is omitted, then it is treated as implied field mask equivalent to all fields that are populated (have a non-empty value). Attributes specified in the update mask without a value specified in the body will be deleted from the product. Update mask can only be specified for top level fields in attributes and custom attributes. To specify the update mask for custom attributes you need to add the `custom_attribute.` prefix. Providing special "*" value for full product replacement is not supported. |
| `params.name` | `string` | Yes | Identifier. The name of the product. Format: `accounts/{account}/productInputs/{productinput}` The {productinput} segment is a unique identifier for the product. This identifier must be unique within a merchant account and generally follows the structure: `content_language~feed_label~offer_id`. Example: `en~US~sku123` For legacy local products, the structure is: `local~content_language~feed_label~offer_id`. Example: `local~en~US~sku123` The format of the {productinput} segment in the URL is automatically detected by the server, supporting two options: 1. **Encoded Format**: The `{productinput}` segment is an unpadded base64url encoded string (RFC 4648 Section 5). The decoded string must result in the `content_language~feed_label~offer_id` structure. This encoding MUST be used if any part of the product identifier (like `offer_id`) contains characters such as `/`, `%`, or `~`. * Example: To represent the product ID `en~US~sku/123`, the `{productinput}` segment must be the base64url encoding of this string, which is `ZW5-VVMtc2t1LzEyMw`. The full resource name for the product would be `accounts/123/productinputs/ZW5-VVMtc2t1LzEyMw`. 2. **Plain Format**: The `{productinput}` segment is the tilde-separated string `content_language~feed_label~offer_id`. This format is suitable only when `content_language`, `feed_label`, and `offer_id` do not contain URL-problematic characters like `/`, `%`, or `~`. We recommend using the **Encoded Format** for all product IDs to ensure correct parsing, especially those containing special characters. The presence of tilde (`~`) characters in the `{productinput}` segment is used to differentiate between the two formats. Note: For calls to the v1beta version, the plain format is `channel~content_language~feed_label~offer_id`, for example: `accounts/123/productinputs/online~en~US~sku123`. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `accounts.productInputs.delete()`

Deletes a product input from your Merchant Center account. After inserting, updating, or deleting a product input, it may take several minutes before the processed product can be retrieved.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.name` | `string` | Yes | Required. The name of the product input to delete. Format: `accounts/{account}/productInputs/{productInput}` The {productInput} segment is a unique identifier for the product. This identifier must be unique within a merchant account and generally follows the structure: `content_language~feed_label~offer_id`. Example: `en~US~sku123` For legacy local products, the structure is: `local~content_language~feed_label~offer_id`. Example: `local~en~US~sku123` The format of the {productInput} segment in the URL is automatically detected by the server, supporting two options: 1. **Encoded Format**: The `{productInput}` segment is an unpadded base64url encoded string (RFC 4648 Section 5).

| `params.dataSource` | `string` | No | Required. The primary or supplemental data source from which the product input should be deleted. Format: `accounts/{account}/dataSources/{datasource}`. For example, `accounts/123456/dataSources/104628`. |

#### `accounts.productInputs.insert()`

[Uploads a product input to your Merchant Center account](/merchant/api/guides/products/add-manage#add_a_product). You must have a products [data source](/merchant/api/guides/data-sources/api-sources#create-primary-data-source) to be able to insert a product. The unique identifier of the data source is passed as a query parameter in the request URL. If a product input with the same contentLanguage, offerId, and dataSource already exists, then the product input inserted by this method replaces that entry. After inserting, updating, or deleting a product input, it may take several minutes before the processed product can be retrieved.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.parent` | `string` | Yes | Required. The account where this product will be inserted. Format: `accounts/{account}` |
| `params.dataSource` | `string` | No | Required. The primary or supplemental product data source name. If the product already exists and data source provided is different, then the product will be moved to a new data source. For more information, see [Create a primary data source](/merchant/api/guides/data-sources/api-sources#create-primary-data-source). Only API data sources are supported. Format: `accounts/{account}/dataSources/{datasource}`. For example, `accounts/123456/dataSources/104628`. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

### `accounts.products`

#### `accounts.products.list()`

Lists the processed products in your Merchant Center account. The response might contain fewer items than specified by `pageSize`. Rely on `pageToken` to determine if there are more items to be requested. After inserting, updating, or deleting a product input, it may take several minutes before the updated processed product can be retrieved.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.parent` | `string` | Yes | Required. The account to list processed products for. Format: `accounts/{account}` |
| `params.pageSize` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of products to return. The service may return fewer than this value. The maximum value is 1000; values above 1000 will be coerced to 1000. If unspecified, the default page size of 25 products will be returned. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | A page token, received from a previous `ListProducts` call. Provide this to retrieve the subsequent page. When paginating, all other parameters provided to `ListProducts` must match the call that provided the page token. |

#### `accounts.products.get()`

Retrieves the processed product from your Merchant Center account. After inserting, updating, or deleting a product input, it may take several minutes before the updated final product can be retrieved.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.name` | `string` | Yes | Required. The name of the product. Format: `accounts/{account}/products/{product}` The `{product}` segment is a unique identifier for the product. This identifier must be unique within a merchant account and generally follows the structure: `content_language~feed_label~offer_id`. Example: `en~US~sku123` For legacy local products, the structure is: `local~content_language~feed_label~offer_id`. Example: `local~en~US~sku123` The format of the `{product}` segment in the URL is automatically detected by the server, supporting two options: 1. **Encoded Format**: The `{product}` segment is an unpadded base64url encoded string (RFC 4648 Section 5). The decoded string must result in the `content_language~feed_label~offer_id` structure.

The full resource name for the product would be `accounts/123/products/ZW5-VVMtc2t1LzEyMw`. 2. **Plain Format**: The `{product}` segment is the tilde-separated string `content_language~feed_label~offer_id`. This format is suitable only when `content_language`, `feed_label`, and `offer_id` do not contain URL-problematic characters like `/`, `%`, or `~`.
