## API Reference

### `people`

#### `people.createContact()`

Create a new contact and return the person resource for that contact. The request returns a 400 error if more than one field is specified on a field that is a singleton for contact sources:

* biographies

* birthdays

* genders

* names Mutate requests for the same user should be sent sequentially to avoid increased latency and failures.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.personFields` | `string` | No | Required. A field mask to restrict which fields on each person are returned. Multiple fields can be specified by separating them with commas. Defaults to all fields if not set. Valid values are: * addresses * ageRanges * biographies * birthdays * calendarUrls * clientData * coverPhotos * emailAddresses * events * externalIds * genders * imClients * interests * locales * locations * memberships * metadata * miscKeywords * names * nicknames * occupations * organizations * phoneNumbers * photos * relations * sipAddresses * skills * urls * userDefined |
| `params.sources` | `string` | No | Optional. A mask of what source types to return. Defaults to READ_SOURCE_TYPE_CONTACT and READ_SOURCE_TYPE_PROFILE if not set. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `people.deleteContact()`

Delete a contact person. Any non-contact data will not be deleted. Mutate requests for the same user should be sent sequentially to avoid increased latency and failures.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.resourceName` | `string` | Yes | Required. The resource name of the contact to delete. |

#### `people.deleteContactPhoto()`

Delete a contact's photo. Mutate requests for the same user should be done sequentially to avoid // lock contention.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.resourceName` | `string` | Yes | Required. The resource name of the contact whose photo will be deleted. |
| `params.personFields` | `string` | No | Optional. A field mask to restrict which fields on the person are returned. Multiple fields can be specified by separating them with commas.

#### `people.updateContact()`

Update contact data for an existing contact person. Any non-contact data will not be modified. Any non-contact data in the person to update will be ignored. All fields specified in the `update_mask` will be replaced. The server returns a 400 error if `person.metadata.sources` is not specified for the contact to be updated or if there is no contact source. The server returns a 400 error with reason `"failedPrecondition"` if `person.metadata.sources.etag` is different than the contact's etag, which indicates the contact has changed since its data was read. Clients should get the latest person and merge their updates into the latest person. If making sequential updates to the same person, the etag from the `updateContact` response should be used to avoid failures. The server returns a 400 error if `memberships` are being updated and there are no contact group memberships specified on the person. The server returns a 400 error if more than one field is specified on a field that is a singleton for contact sources:

* biographies

* birthdays

* genders

* names Mutate requests for the same user should be sent sequentially to avoid increased latency and failures.
