## API Reference

### `projects`

### `projects.locations`

### `projects.locations.operations`

#### `projects.locations.operations.list()`

Lists operations that match the specified filter in the request. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns `UNIMPLEMENTED`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.name` | `string` | Yes | The name of the operation's parent resource. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | The standard list filter. |
| `params.pageSize` | `integer` | No | The standard list page size. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | The standard list page token. |

#### `projects.locations.operations.get()`

Gets the latest state of a long-running operation. Clients can use this method to poll the operation result at intervals as recommended by the API service.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.name` | `string` | Yes | The name of the operation resource. |

### `projects.locations.catalogs`

#### `projects.locations.catalogs.exportAnalyticsMetrics()`

Exports analytics metrics. `Operation.response` is of type `ExportAnalyticsMetricsResponse`. `Operation.metadata` is of type `ExportMetadata`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.catalog` | `string` | Yes | Required. Full resource name of the parent catalog. Expected format: `projects/*/locations/*/catalogs/*` |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `projects.locations.catalogs.list()`

Lists all the Catalogs associated with the project.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.parent` | `string` | Yes | Required. The account resource name with an associated location. If the caller does not have permission to list Catalogs under this location, regardless of whether or not this location exists, a PERMISSION_DENIED error is returned. |
| `params.pageSize` | `integer` | No | Maximum number of Catalogs to return. If unspecified, defaults to 50. The maximum allowed value is 1000. Values above 1000 will be coerced to 1000. If this field is negative, an INVALID_ARGUMENT is returned. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | A page token ListCatalogsResponse.next_page_token, received from a previous CatalogService.ListCatalogs call. Provide this to retrieve the subsequent page. When paginating, all other parameters provided to CatalogService.ListCatalogs must match the call that provided the page token. Otherwise, an INVALID_ARGUMENT error is returned. |

#### `projects.locations.catalogs.patch()`

Updates the Catalogs.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.name` | `string` | Yes | Required. Immutable. The fully qualified resource name of the catalog. |
| `params.updateMask` | `string` | No | Indicates which fields in the provided Catalog to update. If an unsupported or unknown field is provided, an INVALID_ARGUMENT error is returned. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `projects.locations.catalogs.setDefaultBranch()`

Set a specified branch id as default branch. API methods such as SearchService.Search, ProductService.GetProduct, ProductService.ListProducts will treat requests using "default_branch" to the actual branch id set as default. For example, if `projects/*/locations/*/catalogs/*/branches/1` is set as default, setting SearchRequest.branch to `projects/*/locations/*/catalogs/*/branches/default_branch` is equivalent to setting SearchRequest.branch to `projects/*/locations/*/catalogs/*/branches/1`. Using multiple branches can be useful when developers would like to have a staging branch to test and verify for future usage. When it becomes ready, developers switch on the staging branch using this API while keeping using `projects/*/locations/*/catalogs/*/branches/default_branch` as SearchRequest.branch to route the traffic to this staging branch. CAUTION: If you have live predict/search traffic, switching the default branch could potentially cause outages if the ID space of the new branch is very different from the old one. More specifically:

* PredictionService will only return product IDs from branch {newBranch}.

* SearchService will only return product IDs from branch {newBranch} (if branch is not explicitly set).

* UserEventService will only join events with products from branch {newBranch}.

"user-data" will use the dataset imported through CompletionService.ImportCompletionData. `cloud-retail` will use the dataset generated by Cloud Retail based on user events. If left empty, completions will be fetched from the `user-data` dataset. Current supported values: * user-data * cloud-retail: This option requires enabling auto-learning function first. See [guidelines](https://cloud.google.com/retail/docs/completion-overview#generated-completion-dataset). |
| `params.maxSuggestions` | `integer` | No | Completion max suggestions. If left unset or set to 0, then will fallback to the configured value CompletionConfig.max_suggestions. The maximum allowed max suggestions is 20. If it is set higher, it will be capped by 20. |
| `params.enableAttributeSuggestions` | `boolean` | No | If true, attribute suggestions are enabled and provided in the response. This field is only available for the `cloud-retail` dataset. |
| `params.entity` | `string` | No | The entity for customers who run multiple entities, domains, sites, or regions, for example, `Google US`, `Google Ads`, `Waymo`, `google.com`, `youtube.com`, etc. If this is set, it must be an exact match with UserEvent.entity to get per-entity autocomplete results. This field will be applied to `completion_results` only. It has no effect on the `attribute_results`. Also, this entity should be limited to 256 characters, if too long, it will be truncated to 256 characters in both generation and serving time, and may lead to mis-match. To ensure it works, please set the entity with string within 256 characters. |

If the Product to delete does not exist, a NOT_FOUND error is returned. The Product to delete can neither be a Product.Type.COLLECTION Product member nor a Product.Type.PRIMARY Product with more than one variants. Otherwise, an INVALID_ARGUMENT error is returned. All inventory information for the named Product will be deleted. |

#### `projects.locations.catalogs.branches.products.purge()`

Permanently deletes all selected Products under a branch. This process is asynchronous. If the request is valid, the removal will be enqueued and processed offline. Depending on the number of Products, this operation could take hours to complete. Before the operation completes, some Products may still be returned by ProductService.GetProduct or ProductService.ListProducts. Depending on the number of Products, this operation could take hours to complete. To get a sample of Products that would be deleted, set PurgeProductsRequest.force to false.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.parent` | `string` | Yes | Required. The resource name of the branch under which the products are created. The format is `projects/${projectId}/locations/global/catalogs/${catalogId}/branches/${branchId}` |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `projects.locations.catalogs.branches.products.import()`

Bulk import of multiple Products. Request processing may be synchronous. Non-existing items are created. Note that it is possible for a subset of the Products to be successfully updated.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.parent` | `string` | Yes | Required. `projects/1234/locations/global/catalogs/default_catalog/branches/default_branch` If no updateMask is specified, requires products.create permission. If updateMask is specified, requires products.update permission. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `projects.locations.catalogs.branches.products.setInventory()`

Updates inventory information for a Product while respecting the last update timestamps of each inventory field. This process is asynchronous and does not require the Product to exist before updating fulfillment information. If the request is valid, the update is enqueued and processed downstream. As a consequence, when a response is returned, updates are not immediately manifested in the Product queried by ProductService.GetProduct or ProductService.ListProducts. When inventory is updated with ProductService.CreateProduct and ProductService.UpdateProduct, the specified inventory field value(s) overwrite any existing value(s) while ignoring the last update time for this field. Furthermore, the last update times for the specified inventory fields are overwritten by the times of the ProductService.CreateProduct or ProductService.UpdateProduct request. If no inventory fields are set in CreateProductRequest.product, then any pre-existing inventory information for this product is used. If no inventory fields are set in SetInventoryRequest.set_mask, then any existing inventory information is preserved. Pre-existing inventory information can only be updated with ProductService.SetInventory, ProductService.AddFulfillmentPlaces, and ProductService.RemoveFulfillmentPlaces. The returned Operations is obsolete after one day, and the GetOperation API returns `NOT_FOUND` afterwards. If conflicting updates are issued, the Operations associated with the stale updates are not marked as done until they are obsolete.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.name` | `string` | Yes | Immutable. Full resource name of the product, such as `projects/*/locations/global/catalogs/default_catalog/branches/default_branch/products/product_id`. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `projects.locations.catalogs.branches.products.addFulfillmentPlaces()`

We recommend that you use the ProductService.AddLocalInventories method instead of the ProductService.AddFulfillmentPlaces method. ProductService.AddLocalInventories achieves the same results but provides more fine-grained control over ingesting local inventory data. Incrementally adds place IDs to Product.fulfillment_info.place_ids. This process is asynchronous and does not require the Product to exist before updating fulfillment information. If the request is valid, the update will be enqueued and processed downstream. As a consequence, when a response is returned, the added place IDs are not immediately manifested in the Product queried by ProductService.GetProduct or ProductService.ListProducts. The returned Operations will be obsolete after 1 day, and GetOperation API will return NOT_FOUND afterwards. If conflicting updates are issued, the Operations associated with the stale updates will not be marked as done until being obsolete.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.product` | `string` | Yes | Required. Full resource name of Product, such as `projects/*/locations/global/catalogs/default_catalog/branches/default_branch/products/some_product_id`. If the caller does not have permission to access the Product, regardless of whether or not it exists, a PERMISSION_DENIED error is returned. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `projects.locations.catalogs.branches.products.removeFulfillmentPlaces()`

We recommend that you use the ProductService.RemoveLocalInventories method instead of the ProductService.RemoveFulfillmentPlaces method. ProductService.RemoveLocalInventories achieves the same results but provides more fine-grained control over ingesting local inventory data. Incrementally removes place IDs from a Product.fulfillment_info.place_ids. This process is asynchronous and does not require the Product to exist before updating fulfillment information. If the request is valid, the update will be enqueued and processed downstream. As a consequence, when a response is returned, the removed place IDs are not immediately manifested in the Product queried by ProductService.GetProduct or ProductService.ListProducts. The returned Operations will be obsolete after 1 day, and GetOperation API will return NOT_FOUND afterwards. If conflicting updates are issued, the Operations associated with the stale updates will not be marked as done until being obsolete.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.product` | `string` | Yes | Required. Full resource name of Product, such as `projects/*/locations/global/catalogs/default_catalog/branches/default_branch/products/some_product_id`. If the caller does not have permission to access the Product, regardless of whether or not it exists, a PERMISSION_DENIED error is returned. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `projects.locations.catalogs.branches.products.addLocalInventories()`

Updates local inventory information for a Product at a list of places, while respecting the last update timestamps of each inventory field. This process is asynchronous and does not require the Product to exist before updating inventory information. If the request is valid, the update will be enqueued and processed downstream. As a consequence, when a response is returned, updates are not immediately manifested in the Product queried by ProductService.GetProduct or ProductService.ListProducts. Local inventory information can only be modified using this method. ProductService.CreateProduct and ProductService.UpdateProduct has no effect on local inventories. The returned Operations will be obsolete after 1 day, and GetOperation API will return NOT_FOUND afterwards. If conflicting updates are issued, the Operations associated with the stale updates will not be marked as done until being obsolete.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.product` | `string` | Yes | Required. Full resource name of Product, such as `projects/*/locations/global/catalogs/default_catalog/branches/default_branch/products/some_product_id`. If the caller does not have permission to access the Product, regardless of whether or not it exists, a PERMISSION_DENIED error is returned. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `projects.locations.catalogs.branches.products.removeLocalInventories()`

Remove local inventory information for a Product at a list of places at a removal timestamp. This process is asynchronous. If the request is valid, the removal will be enqueued and processed downstream. As a consequence, when a response is returned, removals are not immediately manifested in the Product queried by ProductService.GetProduct or ProductService.ListProducts. Local inventory information can only be removed using this method. ProductService.CreateProduct and ProductService.UpdateProduct has no effect on local inventories. The returned Operations will be obsolete after 1 day, and GetOperation API will return NOT_FOUND afterwards. If conflicting updates are issued, the Operations associated with the stale updates will not be marked as done until being obsolete.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.product` | `string` | Yes | Required. Full resource name of Product, such as `projects/*/locations/global/catalogs/default_catalog/branches/default_branch/products/some_product_id`.
