## API Reference

### `projects`

### `projects.locations`

### `projects.locations.pipelines`

#### `projects.locations.pipelines.create()`

Creates a pipeline. For a batch pipeline, you can pass scheduler information. Data Pipelines uses the scheduler information to create an internal scheduler that runs jobs periodically. If the internal scheduler is not configured, you can use RunPipeline to run jobs.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.parent` | `string` | Yes | Required. The location name. For example: `projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID`. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `projects.locations.pipelines.patch()`

Updates a pipeline. If successful, the updated Pipeline is returned. Returns `NOT_FOUND` if the pipeline doesn't exist. If UpdatePipeline does not return successfully, you can retry the UpdatePipeline request until you receive a successful response.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.name` | `string` | Yes | The pipeline name. For example: `projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID/pipelines/PIPELINE_ID`. * `PROJECT_ID` can contain letters ([A-Za-z]), numbers ([0-9]), hyphens (-), colons (:), and periods (.). For more information, see [Identifying projects](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects#identifying_projects). * `LOCATION_ID` is the canonical ID for the pipeline's location. The list of available locations can be obtained by calling `google.cloud.location.Locations.ListLocations`. Note that the Data Pipelines service is not available in all regions. It depends on Cloud Scheduler, an App Engine application, so it's only available in [App Engine regions](https://cloud.google.com/about/locations#region). * `PIPELINE_ID` is the ID of the pipeline. Must be unique for the selected project and location. |
| `params.updateMask` | `string` | No | The list of fields to be updated. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `projects.locations.pipelines.delete()`

Deletes a pipeline. If a scheduler job is attached to the pipeline, it will be deleted.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.name` | `string` | Yes | Required. The pipeline name. For example: `projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID/pipelines/PIPELINE_ID`. |

#### `projects.locations.pipelines.list()`

Lists pipelines. Returns a "FORBIDDEN" error if the caller doesn't have permission to access it.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.parent` | `string` | Yes | Required. The location name. For example: `projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID`. |
| `params.filter` | `string` | No | An expression for filtering the results of the request. If unspecified, all pipelines will be returned. Multiple filters can be applied and must be comma separated. Fields eligible for filtering are: + `type`: The type of the pipeline (streaming or batch). Allowed values are `ALL`, `BATCH`, and `STREAMING`. + `status`: The activity status of the pipeline. Allowed values are `ALL`, `ACTIVE`, `ARCHIVED`, and `PAUSED`. For example, to limit results to active batch processing pipelines: type:BATCH,status:ACTIVE |
| `params.pageSize` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of entities to return. The service may return fewer than this value, even if there are additional pages. If unspecified, the max limit is yet to be determined by the backend implementation. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | A page token, received from a previous `ListPipelines` call. Provide this to retrieve the subsequent page. When paginating, all other parameters provided to `ListPipelines` must match the call that provided the page token. |

#### `projects.locations.pipelines.get()`

Looks up a single pipeline. Returns a "NOT_FOUND" error if no such pipeline exists. Returns a "FORBIDDEN" error if the caller doesn't have permission to access it.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.name` | `string` | Yes | Required. The pipeline name. For example: `projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID/pipelines/PIPELINE_ID`. |

#### `projects.locations.pipelines.stop()`

Freezes pipeline execution permanently. If there's a corresponding scheduler entry, it's deleted, and the pipeline state is changed to "ARCHIVED". However, pipeline metadata is retained.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.name` | `string` | Yes | Required. The pipeline name. For example: `projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID/pipelines/PIPELINE_ID`. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

#### `projects.locations.pipelines.run()`

Creates a job for the specified pipeline directly. You can use this method when the internal scheduler is not configured and you want to trigger the job directly or through an external system. Returns a "NOT_FOUND" error if the pipeline doesn't exist. Returns a "FORBIDDEN" error if the user doesn't have permission to access the pipeline or run jobs for the pipeline.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.name` | `string` | Yes | Required. The pipeline name. For example: `projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID/pipelines/PIPELINE_ID`. |
| `params.requestBody` | `object` | Yes | The request body. |

### `projects.locations.pipelines.jobs`

#### `projects.locations.pipelines.jobs.list()`

Lists jobs for a given pipeline. Throws a "FORBIDDEN" error if the caller doesn't have permission to access it.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `params.parent` | `string` | Yes | Required. The pipeline name. For example: `projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID/pipelines/PIPELINE_ID`. |
| `params.pageSize` | `integer` | No | The maximum number of entities to return. The service may return fewer than this value, even if there are additional pages. If unspecified, the max limit will be determined by the backend implementation. |
| `params.pageToken` | `string` | No | A page token, received from a previous `ListJobs` call. Provide this to retrieve the subsequent page. When paginating, all other parameters provided to `ListJobs` must match the call that provided the page token. |
